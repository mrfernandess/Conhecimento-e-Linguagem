Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) requires a systematic approach to differentiate 
between central and peripheral causes, as conditions like stroke and vestibular 
neuritis can present similarly. The head impulse, nystagmus, skew deviation, and 
hearing test examination (HINTS+) is effective in distinguishing strokes with 
high sensitivity. Most important for treatment of peripheral AVS includes 
vestibular rehabilitation, while central causes require targeted therapies. A 
multidisciplinary approach is essential for effective diagnosis and management 
in order to improve outcomes and quality of life, as argued in this review.

INTRODUCTION: Hip-spine syndrome is a complex condition characterized by 
concurrent degenerative pathologies of the hip and lumbar spine, often leading 
to significant morbidity. Accurate radiographic measurements are critical for 
diagnosing and managing this syndrome, particularly in the context of total hip 
arthroplasty. This study aimed to evaluate the interobserver reliability of 
sacral slope measurements on pelvic radiographs in healthy individuals to 
enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 30 healthy volunteers (15 male, 15 
female) aged 25 to 50 years, with no history of spinal, hip, or pelvic 
pathology. Lateral pelvic radiographs were taken in both standing and sitting 
positions. Sacral slope was measured by four independent observers, including 
radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons. Intraclass correlation coefficients with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using linear mixed-effects models 
to assess interobserver reliability. Data analysis was performed using SAS and 
SPSS software.
RESULTS: The mean sacral slope measurements for standing and sitting positions 
were as follows: observer 1 (standing: 39.59° ± 6.67°, sitting: 26.83° ± 
10.84°), observer 2 (standing: 38.02° ± 6.76°, sitting: 22.11° ± 10.71°), 
observer 3 (standing: 41.15° ± 6.63°, sitting: 26.04° ± 12.48°), and observer 4 
(standing: 39.53° ± 6.93°, sitting: 24.80° ± 12.00°). The intraclass correlation 
coefficient for standing sacral slope was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.916 to 0.978) and for 
sitting sacral slope was 0.974 (95% CI, 0.944 to 0.988), both indicating 
excellent interobserver reliability.
DISCUSSION: Sacral slope measurements on lateral pelvic radiographs exhibit 
excellent interobserver reliability, making them reliable indicators of pelvic 
orientation. This reliability is crucial for the clinical utility of sacral 
slope as a metric for assessing spinopelvic alignment, particularly in the 
management of hip-spine syndrome and in patients undergoing total hip 
arthroplasty.

In the realm of cellular biochemistry, mitochondria have been increasingly 
recognized for their critical role in both cellular metabolism and the etiology 
of various diseases. Mitochondrial transporters (MTs) are essential for 
maintaining cellular energy dynamics and metabolic fluxes by facilitating the 
bidirectional transfer of metabolites across mitochondrial membranes. 
Dysregulation of these transporters, such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 
(MPC), citrate carrier (SLC25A1), and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), 
disrupts energy metabolism, redox balance, and cellular signaling, contributing 
to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer. In NDDs, impaired 
transporters exacerbate oxidative stress and neuronal death, while in CVDs, they 
lead to energy deficits and heart failure. In T2D, dysfunctional transporters 
like MPC and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) systems drive insulin 
resistance and metabolic dysregulation. In cancer, upregulated transporters such 
as citrate carrier (SLC25A1), and dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) as well as 
metabolic shifts like the Warburg effect support tumor growth and survival. 
Targeting MTs and metabolic reprogramming (MR) offers significant therapeutic 
potential. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of 
mitochondrial-targeted therapies (MTT), such as adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators and antioxidants, in 
restoring metabolic homeostasis and reducing disease pathology. In cancer, 
inhibitors of glutamine transporters and VDAC1 are being explored to disrupt 
tumor metabolism. Several therapies are advancing to clinical trials, including 
mitochondrial-targeted drugs for NDDs and metabolic modulators for T2D and 
cancer, highlighting their translational potential. Despite notable individual 
achievements and isolated reviews in this field, there remains a lack of 
comprehensive syntheses that integrate these advancements. This review seeks to 
combine the prevailing scientific evidence and outline prospective research 
trajectories. The gathered data robustly support the significant potential of 
targeting MTs as a groundbreaking approach in the treatment of complex diseases, 
with the potential to significantly improve health outcomes and mitigate disease 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Angiomyolipomas are often associated with tuberous sclerosis and are 
typically benign soft tissue tumors found incidentally on imaging. The main 
complication is retroperitoneal hemorrhagic rupture, leading to Wunderlich's 
syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case report presents a unique case of a 48-year-old 
Hispanic female patient with Wunderlich's syndrome displaying atypical symptoms, 
including hematemesis, abdominal pain, and nausea. The workup revealed 
significant anemia and renal failure. The patient had no known history of 
tuberous sclerosis. Computed tomography imaging showed retroperitoneal 
hemorrhage from bilateral angiomyolipomas, and the patient was treated with 
arterial embolization for stabilization. No further hemorrhage occurred during 
the hospitalization, and the patient was eventually discharged in stable 
condition.
CONCLUSION: This report presents a case of Wunderlich's syndrome caused by 
hemorrhage of renal angiomyolipomas, presenting as a medical emergency. Although 
renal angiomyolipomas are rare benign tumors, complications such as bleeding can 
occur. Clinicians should consider renal angiomyolipomas in patients with acute 
renal failure, anemia, and abdominal pain to enable early diagnosis and 
treatment.

BACKGROUND-OBJECTIVE: Telogen effluvium (TE) type hair loss is the most common 
cause of diffuse and non-scarring alopecia in women and may develop on the basis 
of many etiological causes. Glass ceiling syndrome, which is a popular research 
topic especially in recent years, is one of the syndromes that define the 
invisible barriers that women face in their careers and can cause long-term 
stress during periods of exposure. Women working in the health sector are 
frequently exposed to the glass ceiling, and this situation has negative effects 
on skin health. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between 
glass ceiling syndrome-induced stress and telogen effluvium, which has not been 
examined before. In addition, another aim of the study is to determine the 
effect of socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, and education level 
on stress symptoms telogen effluvium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 108 female participants 
working in University Hospitals. Questionnaires were used to determine how the 
participants experienced the glass ceiling syndrome, their professional and 
marital status, and their level of education. In addition, an examination 
including a pull test and trichoscopy for telogen effluvium disease was 
performed by specialized doctors.
RESULTS: 56 (51.85%) of 108 female health workers were diagnosed with telogen 
effluvium. It was determined that 73 (67.59%) of them had glass ceiling 
experience. Of the 108 female health workers, 36 were doctors, 44 were nurses, 
and 28 were other health workers. Regarding their education levels, 36 of them 
have a master's degree, 18 have a bachelor's degree, 34 have an associate's 
degree, and 20 have a high school degree. As for marital status, 71 of them were 
married, 24 of them were single, and 13 of them were divorced. A significant 
statistical relationship was found between telogen effluvium and glass ceiling 
syndrome and education and occupational status. At the same time, a significant 
statistical relationship was found between glass ceiling experience and 
education and occupational status.
CONCLUSION: Glass ceiling syndrome is statistically significantly associated 
with telogen effluvium in female health workers, and it is emphasized that this 
situation should not be neglected as a source of intense stress during 
treatment. In addition, professional and marital status and education levels are 
also seen to feed this intense stress source.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic congestion syndrome(PCS) is a complex condition, with ongoing 
controversies regarding its diagnosis, treatment, and long-term effects, 
especially concerning reproductive health. Endovenous embolization performed for 
PCS may alter pelvic hemodynamics and ovarian perfusion, which may change 
ovarian reserve and menstrual cycle characteristics. This study aimed to 
investigate the efficacy and impact of endovenous embolization on ovarian 
reserve and menstrual cycle parameters in patients with PCS.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study analysed data from 81 patients 
diagnosed with PCS who underwent endovenous embolization. Symptom-specific 
Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) scores, serum anti-Müllerian hormone(AMH), 
follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), luteinizing hormone(LH), estradiol(E2), 
prolactin levels, and menstrual cycle characteristics were evaluated before and 
6 and 12 months after the procedure. The primary outcome of this study was 
improvement in symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in serum hormone 
levels and menstrual cycle characteristics. We categorized our study population 
into four age groups(< 30, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-44 years) to minimize the impact 
of age as a confounding variable. These groups were designated as G1, G2, G3, 
and G4, respectively.
RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease was observed in VAS scores related 
to chronic pelvic pain(CPP), dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea. A statistically 
significant decrease in serum AMH levels was observed 6 and 12 months after 
endovenous embolization. We observed a decline in AMH levels in G1, G2, G3, and 
G4(9.75±6.67%, 9.48±4.38%, 12.49±12.11%, and 13.79±11.46%, respectively). No 
significant changes were found in serum FSH, LH, E2, and prolactin levels. 
Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in menstrual cycle duration 
was detected after the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that endovenous embolization appears to be 
an effective treatment modality for symptom relief. The effect of endovenous 
embolization on ovarian reserve was generally consistent with physiological 
changes associated with age, but changes in patients under the age of 30 should 
not be overlooked. Larger, prospective, multi-centre studies are warranted to 
validate these findings and explore the long-term effects of endovenous 
embolization regarding reproductive health.

Adjuvant-induced autoimmune/ autoinflammatory syndrome (ASIA) is a group of 
symptoms that are often found in other systemic, autoimmune diseases, which 
makes its recognition and diagnosis a growing problem in modern clinical 
practice. Although not completely clear, the genesis is associated with 
adjuvants - substances found in implants, vaccines, substances external to the 
body that lead to an exaggerated immune response. Key points of the clinical and 
paraclinical specificity of the disease are arthralgias, myalgias, cognitive 
disorders, and positivity of various autoimmune and inflammatory markers. The 
objectives of this report are to summarize current information about the 
disease, discuss diagnostic criteria, and review therapeutic options, placing 
special interest on the ultrasound findings. The presented case outlines the 
diagnostic difficulty even with the various clinical, imaging, and laboratory 
findings. Directing clinical thought towards this syndrome is of utmost 
importance for its easier recognition in practice and achieving favorable 
outcomes in the treatment of affected patients.

Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis in a 
Helicopter Pilot.

Wetmore EL, Haddon R, Robertson CE, Cowl CT, Elkhatib WY, Garza I.

BACKGROUND: The syndrome of transient headache and neurological deficits with 
cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL syndrome) consists of migraine-like 
headache episodes with >4 h of hemiparesthesia, dysphasia, and/or hemiparesis 
plus cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis. While the rarity of HaNDL 
syndrome often precludes reassurance of the nature of this syndrome, it has 
consistently been identified as a benign condition that lasts no longer than 3 
mo.
CASE REPORT: In the first week of a viral illness, a 29-yr-old male helicopter 
pilot experienced acute-onset ""stumbling"" when walking, ""nonsensical speech,"" 
migraine-like headache, scintillating scotomata, and paresthesias of the tongue 
and bilateral extremities that lasted for 4-6 h. Work-up included lumbar 
puncture, revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis. A week later, he experienced 
word-finding difficulty, right-sided numbness/paresthesia, and severe occipital 
headache lasting 3 h. A third episode with sensory symptoms involving the tongue 
and right arm and leg occurred for a few hours 25 d after the onset of the first 
episode. Symptoms resolved spontaneously. A month following initial discharge, 
he denied symptom recurrence. Repeat lumbar puncture 4 mo later showed 
resolution of his pleocytosis. He was considered neurologically recovered 3 mo 
after symptom onset.
DISCUSSION: This patient's transient episodes were consistent with HaNDL 
syndrome. His symptom resolution involving three episodes within 25 d reflects 
the transient nature of this condition. It is critical to recognize HaNDL 
syndrome as a benign, monophasic disorder that resolves within a maximum of 3 mo 
so that future pilots with a recent history of HaNDL syndrome may safely and 
expeditiously return to work. Wetmore EL, Haddon R, Robertson CE, Cowl CT,

BACKGROUND: Syndrome differentiation is crucial in traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM) diagnosis and treatment, but it heavily relies on expert experience, 
limiting systematic standardization.
OBJECTIVE: This study developed and validated a BERT (bidirectional encoder 
representations from transformers)-based model, the traditional Chinese medicine 
pancreatic cancer syndrome differentiation bidirectional encoder representations 
from transformers (TCMPCSD-BERT), using in-house pancreatic cancer medical 
records, to digitalize expert knowledge and support standardized syndrome 
differentiation in TCM.
METHODS: A retrospective dataset of pancreatic cancer cases (2011-2024) from 
Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center was annotated into 4 TCM syndrome types 
by 2 experts (Cohen κ=0.913). The proposed TCMPCSD-BERT model was compared with 
conventional models (long short-term memory and text convolutional neural 
network) embedded in TCM diagnostic tools and with large language models (LLMs; 
ChatGPT-4o, Kimi, Ernie Bot 4.0 Turbo, and Zhipu Qingyan) under a prompt 
engineering framework. Performance evaluation on in-house data was supplemented 
with attention visualizations and integrated gradients analyses for 
interpretability. The McNemar test assessed classification accuracy differences, 
while bootstrap 95% CIs quantified statistical uncertainty and stability. The 
Welch t test (2-tailed) was used to evaluate mean differences between 
TCMPCSD-BERT and the comparator models.
RESULTS: Among 6830 records, case counts were damp-heat syndrome (n=1694), 
spleen-deficiency syndrome (n=1185), damp-heat with spleen-deficiency syndrome 
(n=1178), and others (n=2773). On the test set, McNemar test showed 
significantly higher accuracy for TCMPCSD-BERT than the 3 baseline models and 
generally better performance than LLMs. In all comparisons, TCMPCSD-BERT 
achieved higher mean macroprecision, macrorecall, macro-F1-score, and accuracy, 
with nonoverlapping 95% bootstrap CIs and significant Welch t test results 
(P<.01). The model achieved a macroprecision of 0.935 (95% CI 0.918-0.951), 
macrorecall of 0.921 (95% CI 0.900-0.942), macro-F1-score of 0.927 (95% CI 
0.908-0.945), and accuracy of 0.919 (95% CI 0.899-0.939). Attention 
visualizations suggested the model could capture less common TCM term 
associations, while integrated gradients highlighted high-attribution diagnostic 
features (eg, ""gray-white stool"" 0.933 in damp-heat syndrome; ""indigestion"" 
1.204 in spleen-deficiency syndrome). Misclassification analyses indicated 
challenges in handling overlapping or atypical symptom presentations. Compared 
with LLMs, web-based platforms, and diagnostic instruments, TCMPCSD-BERT 
appeared to provide relatively higher accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency 
in processing long unstructured texts for syndrome differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: The TCMPCSD-BERT model shows potential for automated syndrome 
differentiation from unstructured clinical texts and broader application in TCM. 
Based on this study, it appears to improve operability over 4-diagnostic 
instruments and web-based platforms, and offers greater stability and accuracy 
than LLMs in specific tasks. However, these findings should be interpreted 
cautiously, given the subjectivity of syndrome definitions, data imbalance, and 
reliance on preprocessed, expert-annotated data. Further studies involving 
larger and more diverse populations are needed to validate its generalizability 
and support its broader application in real-world settings.

INTRODUCTION: This is a retrospective study investigating intracranial pressure 
monitoring (ICPM) as a tool for managing children with craniosynostosis. We 
report on our experience of chronic (≥24 hour) ICP measurement in patients with 
CS and related conditions, with the aim of statistically assessing the 
relationship between ICP and derived variables to clinically relevant patient 
characteristics, such as clinical/ophthalmological symptoms/signs, diagnosis, 
syndrome and surgical management.
METHODS: It is a single-centre study following 32 patients who underwent ICP 
monitoring over 24-72 h. We collected a consecutive series of children 
(aged < 18 years) who underwent invasive ICPM between 1st Jan 2019 and 31st 
December 2021 from our institution's electronic surgical database. All patients 
had either craniosynostosis or foramen magnum pathology. We excluded children 
with non-CS diagnoses, except those with non-CS-related foramen magnum stenosis 
(FMS) who were used as comparative controls. Statistical analysis included the 
Kruskal-Wallis test to compare median ICP results between craniosynostosis and 
foramen magnum pathology, surgery vs non-surgical management, and differences in 
syndromic subgroups. A Spearman correlation was used to determine the relation 
of ICPM results to presentation symptoms.
RESULTS: Results showed that patients who underwent surgery had a higher ICPM 
than those that did not. They also showed that patients with CS had higher ICP 
when compared to foramen magnum pathologies. Results also showed differences in 
pulse altitude (PA) in different subtypes of CS, although not statistically 
significant, and a mild correlation of PA with certain presenting symptoms of CS 
deterioration.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study shows that ICP and PA are safe and useful 
tools that can differentiate between craniosynostosis and similar pathology, as 
well as correlate to symptomatology. Furthermore, the data in this study 
can help us understand what a 'well' ICP is, in patients with various CS 
conditions, which differs from a ""signature"" raised ICP in patients close to 
decompensation. ICP can therefore be a valuable tool in surgical decision 
making, in conjunction with clinical correlation.

Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, caused by the nematode Strongyloides 
stercoralis, is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate. This 
case report describes a 76-year-old woman who developed hyperinfection syndrome 
with gastrointestinal- and pulmonary symptoms shortly after her first round of 
chemotherapy for stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Despite her advanced 
age and frailty, she survived both the severe parasite infection and the 
two-month hospital stay, in addition to managing the challenges posed by the 
advanced-stage lymphoma.

We present a case highlighting the critical role of early recognition of partial 
cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS), as diagnostic delay can lead to irreversible 
tumor progression. A 50-year-old woman presented with subtle binocular diplopia 
and facial tingling sensation for 1 month. Neurological examination revealed 
isolated right abducens nerve (VI) palsy and paresthesia at territories of right 
ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) nerves. Partial CSS was suspected. Brain 
magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a contrast-enhancing mass involving the 
pterygopalatine fossa, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses extending into the 
cavernous sinus. Fiberscope biopsy confirmed nonkeratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC). After consultation with otolaryngologist, concurrent 
chemoradiation as the initial treatment modality was suggested. We describe an 
uncommon etiology of CSS by pterygopalatine SCC invasion, presenting initially 
as subtle cranial nerve palsies. Involvement of lower anatomical structures in 
cavernous sinus and ""mandibular sparing"" can be a hint of invasive lesion from 
pterygopalatine fossa. This case emphasizes the importance of high clinical 
suspicion for partial CSS, as early recognition can have great impact on 
patient's prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of 
Lance-Adams Syndrome (LAS), focusing on its pathophysiology, diagnosis, 
management, and patient outcomes.
METHODS: Utilizing the PICO framework, articles describing known cases of LAS 
and interventions were included, with no specific comparisons. The search was 
conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases.
RESULTS: LAS is characterized by action myoclonus and related symptoms. 
Imbalances in neurotransmitters and involvement of brain areas like the 
cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia play a role in its pathophysiology. 
Diagnosis primarily relies on symptom history post-anoxic events, and treatments 
vary in effectiveness. LAS generally carries a more favorable functional 
prognosis than early post-anoxic status myoclonus, but often remains chronic and 
disabling.
CONCLUSION: LAS is a complex and rare neurological condition requiring early 
diagnosis and specific interventions. The compiled information provides a 
comprehensive overview, assisting clinicians in understanding and managing LAS. 
This review emphasizes the need for ongoing research and individualized patient 
care strategies, seeking to enhance overall patient quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes clinical 
manifestations attributed to estrogen deficiency affecting the genitourinary 
tract of postmenopausal women. Treatment may require a multifaceted approach, 
including patient education, lifestyle modifications, physical, as well as 
hormonal and non-hormonal therapies.
AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of vaginal CO2 laser therapy 
(MonaLisa Touch) combined with an oral food supplement containing bioactive 
collagen peptides (BCP) and other functional components for GSM treatment. We 
hypothesized that this combination would enhance GSM symptom relief.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Twenty postmenopausal women with GSM were divided into two 
groups. Group 1 (n = 10) underwent three sessions of vaginal CO2 laser treatment 
alone, while Group 2 (n = 10) received the same laser treatment in addition to 
oral food supplementation. Improvements in vaginal health (Vaginal Health 
Index-VHI), vaginal pain (Visual Analogue Scale-VAS), and sexual function 
(Female Sexual Function Index-FSFI), along with patient satisfaction and 
tolerability, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Both groups showed improvements in VHI, pain scores, and FSFI, with 
Group 2 displaying more significant gains. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 had 
greater median differences in VHI (Δ = 11.00 vs. Δ = 8.50, p = 0.005) and VAS 
(Δ = -7.00 vs. Δ = -5.50, p = 0.017). Similarly, FSFI scores increased 
meaningfully in both groups, more so in Group 2 (from 53.50 to 67.50, p = 0.005 
vs. from 51.50 to 60.50, p = 0.014 in Group 1). Treatment satisfaction was also 
higher in Group 2 (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of oral supplementation with BCP and other functional 
components to vaginal CO2 laser treatment for GSM offered significant benefits 
over laser treatment alone, improving vaginal health, reducing pain, and 
ameliorating sexual function. This combination therapy presents a promising 
non-hormonal option for GSM management, warranting further investigation in 
larger, long-term studies to confirm these preliminary findings.

One Syndrome, Many Faces: A Unified Perspective on Heart Failure Phenotypes.

Heart failure (HF) remains a major clinical syndrome traditionally classified by 
left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) into three phenotypes: reduced (HFrEF), 
mildly reduced (HFmrEF), and preserved (HFpEF). Although EF-based phenotyping 
has served as a practical framework for diagnosis and treatment stratification, 
growing evidence challenges its pathophysiological specificity. Clinical trials 
often blur these categories by including patients with EF > 40% under the HFpEF 
umbrella, despite current guidelines reserving that range for HFmrEF. This 
inconsistency introduces ambiguity and undermines the concept of discrete 
disease entities. In this comprehensive review, we explore the hypothesis that 
HF is not a group of separate syndromes but rather a single entity manifesting 
along a spectrum determined by the balance between pathological insult and the 
patient's homeostatic adaptive capacity. Emerging data reveal that all HF 
phenotypes, regardless of EF, share common molecular, cellular, and systemic 
mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, fibrosis, and programmed cell death. We propose a paradigm shift: 
from viewing HF through the lens of EF stratification to a unified, 
mechanistically driven model that recognizes HF as a syndrome with variable 
manifestations. Reframing HF in this way could enhance diagnostic precision, 
therapeutic targeting, and research design.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic Striate Syndrome (DSS) is a rare complication of diabetes, 
clinically characterized by chorea-like involuntary movements and contralateral 
basal ganglia abnormalities on brain CT and MRI. The identification of atypical 
DSS cases has broadened our understanding of this complex metabolic disorder.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestations, imaging features, and 
potential pathogenesis of DSS to enhance clinical awareness and understanding of 
the condition.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from eight patients diagnosed 
with DSS who were hospitalized in the Department of Neurology at Beijing 
Chaoyang Hospital, affiliated with Capital Medical University, between January 
2017 and July 2024. Their clinical presentations and imaging findings were 
reviewed, and both typical and atypical features, as well as potential 
pathogenic mechanisms, were discussed in the context of relevant literature.
RESULTS: Among the eight patients, five were female. All patients had a history 
of hypertension, and seven had a prior diagnosis of diabetes. Three patients 
experienced acute or subacute cerebral infarction. Seven patients presented with 
hemichorea, while one patient exhibited bilateral chorea. Random blood glucose 
levels at onset ranged from 7.9 to 27.7 mmol/L, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
levels ranged from 8.7% to 15.5%. One patient tested positive for urinary 
ketones, and one developed symptoms following a rapid drop in blood glucose. 
Head CT scans revealed high-density lesions in the basal ganglia in four 
patients. MRI showed T1-weighted hyperintensity in the basal ganglia in seven 
patients, including one case with bilateral involvement. Hospital stays ranged 
from 6 to 14 days. All patients showed clinical improvement, with one achieving 
complete resolution of symptoms. In three cases, symptom improvement was 
achieved through blood glucose control alone.
CONCLUSION: DSS represents a syndrome with an expanding clinical and imaging 
spectrum as research progresses. In this study, we propose a refined definition 
of the disorder and reaffirm the hypothesis that both basal ganglia ischemia and 
hyperglycemia synergistically contribute to the development and progression of 
DSS.

The authors present the first documented case of the apparent effective use of 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for the treatment of radiation-induced dropped 
head syndrome (DHS). DHS is a condition associated with progressive and often 
severe weakness of cervical paraspinal muscles, especially the neck extensors. 
This results in loss of horizontal gaze and in advanced cases causes a 
chin-on-chest deformity. Radiation-induced DHS is a rare, primarily late-term 
complication first described in patients treated with mantle field radiotherapy 
for Hodgkin lymphoma, though there is an increasing body of literature 
demonstrating a wide range of presentations. A 59-year-old man with a history of 
stage 2A Hodgkin lymphoma 34 years prior had been treated with extended field 
radiotherapy, including mantle radiotherapy, totalling 40 Gy in 19 fractions. He 
presented with three years of progressive neck extension weakness with 
associated stiffness and intermittent dysphagia. The patient underwent 60 
sessions of HBOT, in conjunction with physiotherapy and thiamine replacement and 
demonstrated improvement of his postural maintenance and dysphagia. His improved 
function was maintained at three years follow-up. We discuss the literature on 
the management of this rare condition, including the rationale for using HBOT 
which is well documented for the treatment of other late-term radiotherapy side 
effects. This case adds to the increasing literature on the management of DHS 
and describes a novel approach to the management of this often-debilitating 
condition.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and feasibility of injection of autologous 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the vagina and posterior fourchette and to 
evaluate 6-month efficacy for treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause 
(GSM) in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-arm pilot study of breast cancer 
survivors (stage 0-III) who reported vaginal dryness with or without 
dyspareunia. Participants underwent a one-time treatment with 7 mL autologous 
PRP injected throughout the vaginal canal and posterior fourchette into 35 
sites. The primary outcome was to assess safety and feasibility. Secondary 
outcomes included VMI (Vaginal Maturation Index), VHI (Vaginal Health Index), 
VAS/VuAS (Vaginal and Vulvar Assessment Scales), DIVA (Day-to-Day Impact of 
Vaginal Aging questionnaire), FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index), and UDI-6 
(Urogenital Distress Inventory-Short Form) scores. Vaginal caliber was measured 
with silicone dilators. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was 
assessed with a 7-point Likert scale.
RESULTS: Twenty participants were treated; mean±SD age and body mass index (BMI) 
were 53.6±7.5 years and 27.2±4.6, respectively. Most had hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer (85.0%), and of those, 65.0% were taking an 
aromatase inhibitor. All participants completed the planned protocol. Treatment 
adverse events included vaginal spotting, irritation, discharge, burning, 
cramping, and mild pain, all resolving within 24 hours. No serious adverse 
events occurred. VAS/VuAS, FSFI, UDI-6, DIVA, VHI, and total scores showed 
significant improvement from baseline to 6 months; the VMI change was 
nonsignificant. At 6 months, 90.0% of patients had an increase in vaginal 
caliber as measured by change in dilator size, and 95.0% noted improvement of 
symptoms on PGI-I.
CONCLUSION: A single treatment of autologous PRP injected diffusely through the 
vaginal canal and posterior fourchette is safe and feasible. In this 
uncontrolled pilot trial, at 6 months, treatment significantly improved GSM 
symptoms, sexual function, urinary symptoms, and quality of life in breast 
cancer survivors, including those on aromatase inhibitors.

OBJECTIVE: Depression, a most common psychiatric disease, is defined in 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as Yu Syndrome, i.e., depression disorder, or 
Baihe Disease, i.e., lily bulb disease, a category of emotional disorders 
treated with lily-based TCM preparations. In TCM, depression is managed through 
syndrome differentiation and treatment, which is characterized by high efficacy 
and safety. However, there is no unified standard for the classification of 
depression syndromes, which leads to a disconnection between the analysis of 
patients' medication patterns and their actual syndromes and hinders the study 
of medication patterns specific to particular syndromes. Therefore, this study 
is focused on investigating the medication patterns of different sub-types of 
depression patients based on an objective classification system of depression.
METHODS: We searched for and retrieved clinical literature on TCM formulas for 
depression from relevant databases, including China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP Database, Sinomed, Web of Science, and 
PubMed. Information on patient symptoms and medication was standardized. Then, 
the symptoms and the medication frequency of depression patients were 
statistically analyzed. We used the K-means clustering method combined with 
implicit structural analysis to objectively categorize depression patients into 
sub-types. In addition, the main symptoms and core TCM formulas of each sub-type 
of depression patients were identified. On the basis of objective classification 
system, we also statistically analyzed the characteristics of herbs used on 
depression patients, including the 4 basic properties, the 5 flavors, the 
attributes, the therapeutic efficacy, and the co-occurrence patterns, which may 
help reveal the medication patterns.
RESULTS: A total of 3537 publications and 4434 prescriptions were included in 
the analysis. By using the K-means algorithm and latent structure analysis 
methods, patients with depression were categorized into 9 sub-types, with 
Cluster 6 accounting for the largest proportion. The most common symptoms among 
depression patients were insomnia and a depressed mood. Medication frequency 
analysis showed that Radix Bupleuri (Chai Hu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (Bai Shao), 
Poria (Fu Ling), Rhizoma Chuanxiong (Chuan Xiong), and Radix Curcumae (Yu Jin) 
were the most commonly used TCM herbs. For the depression sub-types of Clusters 
1, 2, and 6, blood-activating and stasis-dissolving herbs were used most often. 
The depression sub-types of Clusters 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 were mainly treated with 
qi-regulating herbs, while the depression sub-type of Cluster 7 was treated with 
qi-supplementing herbs. Depression patients were mostly treated with herbs that 
were cold or warm in nature and had sweet, bitter, and pungent flavors. 
Moreover, treatments for Cluster 1 and Cluster 6 mainly targeted the spleen 
meridian, while those for Cluster 2, Cluster 3, Cluster 4 and Cluster 5 mainly 
targeted the heart meridian. The treatments for the other sub-types mainly 
targeted the liver meridian. The core TCM formulas for the 9 depression 
sub-types included Zishui Qinggan Decoction, Danzhi Xiaoyao Powder, Huanglian 
Wendan Tang, Chaihu Guizhi Tang, Modified Xiaoyao Powder, Qinggan Jieyu Tang, 
Xiaoyao Powder, Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction, and Bazhen Decoction. The most commonly 
used Chinese herbal medicinal formulas were Gan Cao-Chai Hu, Bai Shao-Chai Hu, 
and Chen Pi-Chai Hu.
CONCLUSION: Based on machine learning, this study reveals the scientific aspects 
of TCM typing and syndrome-based treatment. It clarifies the rationale for 
targeting different symptoms in depression treatment and provides theoretical 
support for clinicians to make medication prescriptions. It also presents a new 
perspective for investigating TCM medication patterns.

抑郁症是最常见的精神类疾病，属于中医“郁证、百合病”范畴。中医通过辨证论治治疗抑郁症具有疗效佳、安全性好的特点，但抑郁症辨证分型没有统一标准，造成在分析患者用药规律时与患者证候脱节，导致更具体的针对某一证候的用药规律研究无从下手。因此，本研究拟在对抑郁患者客观分型的基础上，研究不同亚型抑郁症患者的用药规律。
方法: 通过收集相关数据库（包括中国知网、万方、维普、Sinomed、Web of 
Science以及PubMed）中的中药复方治疗抑郁症的临床文献，对患者症状和用药信息进行规范化处理，统计抑郁患者的症状频次、用药频次。利用K-means聚类方法结合隐结构分析方法，对抑郁症患者进行客观分型，同时总结每一类亚型抑郁患者的主要证候以及所用核心方剂，并且在客观分型的基础上统计抑郁患者所用中药的四气五味归经、药物功效以及药物共现分析，以揭示其中的用药规律。
结果: 共纳入3537篇文献，收录方剂4434首。基于K-means算法以及隐结构分析方法将抑郁患者分为9个亚型，其中占比最高的为Cluster 
6。抑郁患者最常见的症状为失眠与情绪低落；药物频次分析表明，柴胡、白芍、茯苓、川芎和郁金是应用最广泛的中药材；Cluster 1、Cluster 
2与Cluster 6抑郁患者亚型使用最多的是活血化瘀药，Cluster 3、Cluster 4、Cluster 5、Cluster 8和Cluster 
9抑郁患者亚型使用最多的为理气药，而Cluster 7抑郁患者亚型则使用补气药最多；抑郁患者使用药物多性寒、温，五味以甘、苦、辛味为主；Cluster 
1与Cluster 6主入脾经，Cluster 2、Cluster 3、Cluster 4、Cluster 
5主入心经，其余亚型主入肝经。9个抑郁患者亚型使用的核心方剂分别为滋水清肝饮、丹栀逍遥散、黄连温胆汤、柴胡桂枝汤、加减逍遥散、清肝解郁汤、逍遥散、血府逐瘀汤以及八珍汤；使用频次最高的药对分别为甘草-柴胡、白芍-柴胡、陈皮-柴胡。
结论: 
基于机器学习的方法，本研究揭示了中医分型和辨证论治的科学性，明确了从患者不同证型入手治疗抑郁症的合理性，为临床医师遣方用药提供了可参考的理论依据，也为中药方剂用药规律的研究提供了新的研究思路。

Description of TEMPI syndrome in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.

[Article in English]

BACKGROUND: TEMPI syndrome (telangiectasia, erythrocytosis with increased 
erythropoietin, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephritic fluid collections, and 
intrapulmonary shunts) was described by David Sykes in 2011. By the end of March 
2025, we have found descriptions of 35 cases of TEMPI syndrome in the 
literature. Non-IgM monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance was diagnosed 
in 23 patients, multiple myeloma in 10 patients and Waldenström's 
macroglobulinemia in only 2 cases. Sykes estimated the median interval from the 
first symptoms to the diagnosis at 10 years. For many years, these patients were 
treated for a misdiagnosis of secondary erythrocytosis or primary polycythemia.
OBSERVATION: In 2015, an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations 
was found in the patient. The diagnosis was concluded as secondary 
erythrocytosis in obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Telangiectasias, which 
appeared soon after the detection of erythrocytosis, were misinterpreted as a 
manifestation of hepatopathy. The patient was treated with therapeutic 
phlebotomy. In 2024, symptoms of pleural effusion, ascites, swelling of the 
perineum and genitals appeared. This was the reason for admission to the 
hospital.
RESULTS: CT scan in 2024 revealed pleural effusions, large perinephritic fluid 
collections and confirmed clinically evident swelling of the perineum and 
genitals (pelvic effusion). This gave rise to the suspicion of TEMPI syndrome. 
The results of morphological, flow-cytometric and molecular biological 
examination of the bone marrow and high concentrations of total immunoglobulin 
type IgM (40.6 g/L) and monoclonal immunoglobulin type IgM (23.6 g/L) with 
cryoglobulin properties corresponded to Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. 
Contrast echocardiography confirmed the existence of arteriovenous shunts, which 
could not be localized by other methods. Other abnormalities included very low 
levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid. Laboratory examination did not show 
significant endocrinopathy. After therapeutic plasmapheresis, treatment with 
rituximab, bendamustine and dexamethasone was started in December 2024.
CONCLUSION: In each differential diagnosis of secondary erythrocytosis, it is 
necessary to examine monoclonal immunoglobulin to exclude its cause in TEMPI or 
POEMS syndrome. A large perinephritic fluid collection is diagnostic of only two 
diagnoses, TEMPI syndrome or renal lymphangiomatosis, while other renal diseases 
can cause a smaller volume of perirenal fluid collection.

RATIONALE: Neurogenic pectoralis minor syndrome (NPMiS) is an underdiagnosed 
cause of persistent neck, shoulder, and upper extremity pain. It can mimic 
cervical radiculopathy or other musculoskeletal disorders, often resulting in 
misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment. This case series presents 5 patients 
with NPMiS who achieved symptomatic relief through diagnostic ultrasound-guided 
pectoralis minor muscle (PMiM) block followed by targeted rehabilitation.
PATIENT CONCERNS: All patients presented with persistent neck pain often 
radiating to the scapula or anterior chest wall, along with paresthesia and 
impaired sleep quality. Prior treatments, including non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy, were 
ineffective. One patient was referred for spine surgery before alternative 
evaluation.
DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis of NPMiS was based on detailed clinical history, 
positive physical exam findings (e.g., Roos test, focal PMiM tenderness), and 
exclusion of cervical radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathies via imaging and 
electrophysiological studies. Confirmatory diagnosis was established with 
significant symptom relief following ultrasound-guided PMiM block.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients received diagnostic ultrasound-guided injection of 1% 
lidocaine into the PMiM. This was followed by an individualized rehabilitation 
program including posture correction, ergonomic adjustments, and physical 
therapy focused on pectoral muscle stretching and shoulder stabilization.
OUTCOMES: Patients experienced rapid pain reduction, improved function, reduced 
medication use, and better sleep. Sustained symptom relief was achieved through 
adherence to rehabilitation.
LESSONS: NPMiS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic, 
non-dermatomal neck and upper extremity pain, particularly when standard 
treatments fail. Ultrasound-guided PMiM block is a valuable tool both for 
confirming diagnosis and initiating effective, personalized therapy strategies.

BACKGROUND: Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a common condition in the digital 
era, causing fatigue in users exceeding four hours of screen time daily. It 
manifests as blurred vision, itching, dryness, and eye fatigue. This study 
examined the prevalence and risk factors for CVS among university students.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 230 students using simple 
sampling. A structured questionnaire included: (1) demographic data, (2) digital 
device use and ergonomic habits, and (3) CVS symptom frequency and severity 
based on the validated CVS-Q© scale.
RESULTS: A total of 76.1% of the participants were found to have CVS, with a 
higher prevalence among female students (80.2%) compared to male students 
(70.7%). 87.4% of the subjects (n = 201) experienced one or more symptoms of 
CVS. Most of them experience headaches (60.4%, n = 139), eye irritation (55.7%, 
n = 128), tearing (50.9%, n = 116), and discomfort in the eyes (49.6%, n = 114). 
Female students scored a higher mean of CVS than male students (p = .004). Risk 
factors were a lack of adequate rest between screen watching periods (p ≤ .001) 
and failure to observe the 20-20-20 rule (p = .015).
CONCLUSION: The study indicates that the prevalence of CVS is extremely high 
among the students, and, therefore, there is a need for ergonomic interventions 
to be implemented widely and used for prevention or alleviation of symptoms of 
CVS.

This paper reports a case of red ear syndrome, a rare clinical condition, 
treated with acupuncture. At the initial consultation, the diagnosis was unclear 
from a western medical perspective. The advantage of traditional Chinese 
medicine in ""prioritizing symptoms and syndrome differentiation"" was fully 
utilized. Based on the patient's clinical manifestations, disease progression, 
tongue and pulse conditions, the treatment addressed the branch by targeting 
meridian qi stagnation based on the hand-taiyang sinew meridian theory, and 
treated the root by selecting acupoints according to syndrome differentiation 
for liver and kidney yin deficiency. A combined treatment of tendon needling and 
acupuncture produced immediate results after the first session. Subsequent 
sessions were administered every other day for a total of ten treatments. The 
patient's ear pain and redness symptoms had nearly disappeared, and a two-month 
follow-up showed good overall condition.

Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.

Key aspects of pain syndrome in urology, including its classification, 
pathogenesis, and current treatment approaches, are discussed in the article. 
Special attention is given to the phenomenon of chronic pelvic pain, defined as 
persistent pain lasting at least three months, accompanied by dysfunction of the 
genitourinary system and emotional disorders. The main pathogenetic mechanisms 
underlying pain syndrome determine its complex multisystem nature, which 
requires a comprehensive approach to both diagnosis and treatment. Various 
etiologies of urologic chronic pain syndrome are described. Particular emphasis 
is given on urological causes such as bacterial cystitis and interstitial 
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Clinical phenotypes of IC/BPS are 
discussed, along with individualized treatment approaches for each phenotype. 
The impact of pain syndrome in bacterial cystitis on quality of life and the 
role of phenazopyridine in pain relief are also highlighted. The importance of 
an interdisciplinary approach and the combination of different therapeutic 
methods to achieve good outcomes in the management of pain syndrome is 
emphasized.

the Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY (Dr. Ang); and the Boston Children's 
Hospital, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Boston, MA (Dr. Liu and Dr. Hogue).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive step-wise 
management algorithm for Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population by 
conducting a systematic review of the current literature regarding the 
diagnostic evaluation, nonsurgical and surgical treatment, and outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed to 
identify studies focused on the management of Bertolotti syndrome in the 
pediatric population. Data extraction of clinical presentation, management 
strategies, imaging, and outcomes was completed.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies reported on 17 patients younger than 18 years with 
confirmed diagnosis of Bertolotti syndrome were identified. Lower back pain was 
the most common presenting symptom and was described in all 13 studies. 
Radicular pain was described in six of 13 studies. Diagnostic, intraoperative, 
and postoperative assessments included preoperative radiographs, CT, MRI, along 
with targeted injections. Treatment options ranged from nonsurgical to surgical 
measures. Conservative options included physical therapy, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications, bracing treatment, and targeted injections. 
Surgical modalities included open surgical resection and posterior spinal 
fusion. All patients in the 13 studies demonstrated partial or complete 
resolution of their presenting symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a proposed systemic algorithm for the 
management of Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population. Based on our 
review of the current literature, we recommend a stepwise approach to the 
management of Bertolotti syndrome starting from conservative options and 
progressing toward surgical treatment if symptoms persist.

Current network pharmacology methods for TCM formulae predict potential active 
ingredients and mechanisms of action for specific diseases by constructing a 
formula-ingredient-target-pathway-disease network. Syndrome differentiation and 
treatment, a core principle of TCM, embodies its holistic and dynamic approach, 
emphasizing individual variability and disease progression. By integrating 
syndrome characteristics into this network, researchers can develop multi-target 
drugs tailored to each disease stage, enabling precise and personalized 
treatment. The TCM Syndrome Ontology and Multidimensional Quantitative 
Association Computing Platform (SoFDA) allow the incorporation of TCM syndromes 
into network pharmacology analysis. In this study, we used Lingguizhugan 
Decoction (formula) as an example to demonstrate its application in treating 
obesity with Yang Deficiency Syndrome and Dampness-Phlegm Syndrome (syndromes). 
We first identified key active ingredients from the TCMSP database. We then 
constructed a network linking diseases, syndromes, target genes, and signaling 
pathways using SoFDA. Finally, we integrated these data to build a 
formula-ingredient-target-pathway-syndrome-disease network.

Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement 
responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is a brainstem syndrome marked by punctate 
'pepper-and-salt' enhancement on MRI and corticosteroid responsiveness. Evidence 
suggests that CLIPPERS may represent a cancer-related immune reaction, occurring 
before tumour detection, in association with active malignancy or after 
treatment. We report the first case associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC). A middle-aged woman developed facial numbness and ataxia; MRI showed 
pontocerebellar enhancement, and work-up revealed PTC. Neurological signs 
resolved after total thyroidectomy. Sixteen months later, neurological symptoms 
recurred. Repeat MRI reproduced the CLIPPERS pattern. High-dose intravenous 
methylprednisolone followed by a short taper induced rapid and sustained 
clinical and radiological remission. Serial neck ultrasound and serum 
thyroglobulin measurements confirmed no evidence of PTC recurrence. This case 
illustrates that CLIPPERS can precede, remit after and recur independently of 
cancer activity, highlighting the importance of comprehensive malignancy 
screening and long-term oncological surveillance.

Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan.

Objective: Mauriac syndrome (MS) is a rare condition linked to inadequate 
glycemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and has also rarely been 
reported in patients with neonatal diabetes. MS manifests as growth failure, 
delayed puberty, cushingoid features, and hepatomegaly. The condition can be 
associated with complications like dyslipidemia, retinopathy, and nephropathy. 
The main objective of this study was to describe the magnitude of the condition, 
clinical features, management, and outcome of Sudanese children and adolescents 
with MS due to inadequate control of diabetes in our center. Study Design and 
Methods: This is a cross-sectional hospital-based study. All medical records of 
patients with MS were reviewed. Data, including demographics, clinical features, 
investigations, management, and outcome, were obtained. Patients were 
re-educated and management intensified then followed up. Results: 
Thirty-seven MS patients were enrolled in this study, with a male predominance 
of 59.5%. Neonatal diabetes was diagnosed in 5.4% of the patients, while others 
had T1DM. The median age at diagnosis of MS was 12 years. The diagnosis was 
based solely on clinical findings, including a history of prolonged 
unsatisfactory glycemic control, short stature, and hepatomegaly. Regarding the 
outcome, eight children (21.6%) were lost to follow-up, one patient died (2.7%), 
seven (18.9%) had a static condition, and those who showed improvement were 21 
(56.8%). Signs of improvement were a decrease in liver size with or without an 
increase in growth velocity. Nephropathy was the most common associated 
complication; it was seen in 33.3% of our cohort. Some got it at a very young 
age. Conclusions: Despite many efforts that have been made to achieve better 
glycemic control in children with T1DM, MS still exists in our setting. Though 
liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, being invasive, the diagnosis 
could be made conservatively, based on clinical features and response to 
treatment. The condition can be reversed with good metabolic control.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health concern in 
Thailand, with most patients diagnosed at the intermediate stage. Transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment; however, postembolization 
syndrome (PES) remains a common complication. Although both dexamethasone (DEXA) 
and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have shown efficacy in reducing PES, no study has 
directly compared their effects.
AIM: To compare the incidence of PES between DEXA and NAC in intermediate-stage 
HCC patients undergoing conventional TACE (cTACE).
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at two 
tertiary hospitals in Thailand from November 2024 to April 2025. Eligible HCC 
patients (aged 18-70 years) were randomized (1:1) to receive either NAC (150 
mg/kg/hour loading dose, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 6.25 mg/kg/ 
hour for 48 hours post-cTACE) or DEXA (8 mg IV 1 hour before cTACE). cTACE was 
performed by blinded interventional radiologists. The primary outcome was PES 
occurrence within 48 hours, assessed using South West Oncology Group toxicity 
coding and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The secondary 
outcomes were post-cTACE liver decompensation and the dynamic changes in the 
albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score.
RESULTS: A total of 56 intermediate-stage HCC patients were included (DEXA, n = 
28; NAC, n = 28). Most had preserved liver function, with 92.9% classified as 
Child-Pugh A. The maximum tumor size was 6.2 cm, and 85.7% had multiple lesions. 
Additionally, 39 patients (69.6%) met the beyond up-to-7 criteria. Overall, 27 
patients (48.2%) developed PES. After adjusting for confounding factors, the NAC 
group had a significantly lower incidence of PES than the DEXA group (32.1% vs 
64.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.87, P = 
0.033). Only two patients (3.6%) developed post-cTACE liver decompensation. 
Furthermore, 51.8% patients experienced worsening ALBI scores within 48 hours 
post-procedure; however, the rate of ALBI score worsening did not significantly 
differ between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Compared with DEXA, NAC significantly reduces the incidence of PES, 
regardless of its impact on liver function recovery. Therefore, NAC is a 
preferable option for reducing PES in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-B stage HCC 
patients with preserved liver function.

BACKGROUND: Refractive surgeries such as LASIK have markedly improved the 
correction of refractive errors and are widely performed globally. Despite their 
benefits, the long-term sequelae of these procedures, particularly postoperative 
complications like interface fluid syndrome (IFS), are not fully understood due 
to the relatively recent adoption and continuous evolution of these techniques. 
Accurate diagnosis and management of such complications are crucial to prevent 
irreversible vision loss.
PURPOSE: This video is designed to enhance the understanding and clinical skills 
of ophthalmologists regarding IFS, highlighting its potential as a rare but 
sight-threatening condition following myopic LASIK surgery. It aims to raise 
awareness about the nuances of diagnosing and managing IFS effectively.
SYNOPSIS: The featured video narrates the case of a post-LASIK patient who 
presents with defective vision attributed to IFS. It elaborates on the 
diagnostic journey, including the challenges encountered with conventional 
intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement tools and the critical role of advanced 
imaging techniques. The video further discusses treatment adjustments, such as 
the discontinuation of steroids and the administration of antiglaucoma 
medications, which markedly improved the patient's condition.
HIGHLIGHTS: • Discusses the differential diagnosis between IFS and diffuse 
lamellar keratitis (DLK). • Emphasizes the limitations of traditional IOP 
measurement tools post-LASIK and the need for alternative methods. • Outlines 
key clinical indicators of IFS, including increased central corneal thickness 
and peripheral corneal edema. • Recommends specific diagnostic techniques and 
management strategies to prevent long-term visual impairment.

BACKGROUND: Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a frequent issue leading 
to bowel dysfunction after anterior resection surgery. NICE guidelines state 
that there is limited research around the management of LARS. Transanal 
irrigation (TAI) is a suggested treatment by guidelines; however, there is 
limited research surrounding the effectiveness of this treatment.
AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TAI 
in reducing LARS score post anterior resection surgery.
METHODS: Patients who were referred to the pelvic floor nurse specialist team 
between 2019 and 2023 with bowel dysfunction post anterior resection surgery 
were evaluated. Bowel dysfunction was assessed using the LARS scoring system 
during the first assessment and on discharge. These patients were offered TAI 
and trained to perform TAI. Patients with missing LARS scores and those who were 
not using TAI were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: Of the total 37 patients who were referred and using TAI, 16 were 
excluded. In total, 21 patients were included (12 male, 9 female). At baseline, 
33% of patients were recorded to have minor LARS, and 66% with major LARS. At 
discharge, there was a significant improvement in LARS score (80% of patients 
reported no LARS, 10% minor LARS and 10% major LARS). Overall, the LARS score at 
discharge was significantly lower among patients who underwent irrigation (mean 
34.57 vs. 12.48, p = 0.0000000038).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows the importance of TAI in the management of bowel 
dysfunction post anterior resection for rectal cancer, with more than two-third 
of patients' symptom improvement.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with dysphagia typically experience multiple 
co-occurring symptoms, whose interrelationships can vary in strength. The 
significance and impact of each symptom within dysphagia also differ. However, 
the intricate web of connections among these symptoms remains poorly understood, 
making it challenging to assess the importance of individual symptoms from a 
relational perspective.
AIM: The aim of this study was to: 1) construct a correlation map that 
identifies the risk associations within dysphagia-related syndromes; and 2) rank 
syndromes according to the Overall Benefit Index (OBI) of a specific functional 
intervention, which varies in their impact on the overall functional status.
DESIGN: This study has a cross-sectional design.
SETTING: The setting of this study was a tertiary hospital in Hunan Province, 
China.
POPULATION: Population considered in this study included patients with 
non-esophageal dysphagia.
METHODS: Adopting convenience sampling, we recruited 150 patients with dysphagia 
to assess their health-related quality of life through the dysphagia-specific 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Scale. 
A network structure of 50 second-level or third-level ICF categories was 
investigated by the Ising model. The Bayesian model was applied to determine the 
probability of the existence of the connection among ICF functional categories.
RESULTS: The resulting network consisted of 50 nodes and 64 connections. 48 
functional categories demonstrated a significant OBI, with ""d9102 Ceremonies"" 
(OBI=1.00) achieving the highest OBI. ""d9204 Hobbies"" (OBI=0.862), and ""d9205 
Socializing"" (OBI=0.847) were another top two categories with the 2nd and 3rd 
highest OBI. There was a significant correlation between network parameters, 
OBI, and item difficulty. Specifically, item difficulty showed a positive 
correlation with OBI (P<0.001, rPearson=0.712), indicating that more challenging 
items tend to correspond with higher OBIs.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ising model is a powerful tool that can assist rehabilitation 
clinicians in better understanding the complex functional network and guide 
specific rehabilitation interventions for patients with dysphagia.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Cooperating the item difficulties from the Item 
Response Theory (IRT) into the OBI from the Ising model could guide 
individualized clinical decisions based on item difficulties and importance.

A female patient in her sixth decade of life presented with a 7-day history of 
progressive diminution of vision and restricted ocular motility associated with 
fever, headache and vomiting. On general examination, she was febrile 
(temperature 100.4°F) and had enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, along with 
multiple nodules on the scalp and upper back. At baseline, ocular examination 
revealed visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and hand movements close to the 
face in the left eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left 
eye. The Hirschberg test revealed left esotropia (15°°) with an abduction 
deficit, suggestive of left sixth cranial nerve paresis. Fundus examination was 
unremarkable. A provisional diagnosis of left orbital apex syndrome (OAS) was 
made. A comprehensive work-up in neurology and dermatology was performed. 
Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbit suggested an asymmetrically 
enhancing lesion of the cavernous sinus, soft tissue involvement of the left 
orbital apex and a nodule involving the white matter of the left parietal lobe. 
Hormone analysis suggested a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, 
follicular-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. Fine needle aspiration 
cytology of a submandibular lymph node and nodules of the scalp and upper back 
was suggestive of metastatic mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma. Tumour marker 
analysis revealed raised CEA and CA 125. Further, a positron emission tomography 
scan revealed active lesions in the lungs with multiorgan spread, supporting the 
diagnosis of primary lung carcinoma with disseminated metastases manifesting as 
OAS. In view of the poor prognosis, the patient refused further treatment and 
succumbed to her condition 1 month following her diagnosis.This case highlights 
the importance of recognising subtle ocular signs, as they can be indicative of 
underlying life-threatening conditions. Early detection and thorough 
investigation of such symptoms are crucial, as they can lead to the 
identification of serious systemic diseases, such as metastatic cancer, that may 
otherwise be overlooked.

[Expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of low anterior resection 
syndrome (2025 edition)].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Chinese Society of Coloproctology, Chinese Medical Doctor Association.

Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a common bowel dysfunction syndrome 
following sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer, characterized by stool 
storage dysfunction and evacuatory dysfunction. It has become a critical factor 
adversely affecting patients' quality of life and long-term clinical outcomes. 
Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms of LARS remain incompletely elucidated, and 
high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice is still lacking. However, 
emerging evidence suggests that strategic optimization across the clinical 
management pathway-including precision oncology planning, surgical technique 
selection, multidimensional symptom profiling, proactive prevention protocols, 
and comprehensive symptom management-may effectively reduce LARS severity and 
improve survivorship outcomes. Given the absence of consensus guidelines for 
LARS management among clinicians across China, the Chinese Society of 
Coloproctology (Chinese Medical Doctor Association) organized domestic experts 
in relevant fields. Through systematic review of global research findings, 
integration of international expertise and guidelines, and adaptation to 
domestic clinical realities, we developed the ""Chinese Expert Consensus on the 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (2025 Edition)"". This 
consensus elaborates on key aspects including the definition, clinical 
manifestations, risk factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, symptom assessment, 
treatment modalities, and prevention strategies for LARS, aiming to standardize 
the diagnosis and management of LARS in China.

Emphysema is common in fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, and its combination 
with pulmonary fibrosis is known as ""Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema 
(CPFE) syndrome"". The diagnosis of CPFE significantly impacts treatment 
strategies and prognosis. In this article, we report the clinical, imaging, and 
especially the pathological features of two CPFE patients. Case 1: A 51-year-old 
male patient with a history of smoking. CT scans revealed interstitial lung 
disease combined with pulmonary bullae. Pathology showed extensive deposition of 
mononuclear cells in the alveolar spaces, with some cells phagocytosing pigment. 
Mild fibrous tissue hyperplasia was present in the lung interstitium, along with 
chronic inflammation and lymphoid nodule formation. The histological findings 
were consistent with desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and the 
clinical, imaging, and pathological correlation confirmed a diagnosis of CPFE. 
Case 2: A 58-year-old male, a driver with a history of dust exposure and 
smoking, was admitted due to chest tightness and a cough for 2 years. Chest CT 
revealed interstitial changes, emphysema, and bullae in both lungs. 
Histopathology showed fibrous widening of alveolar septa, mild chronic 
inflammation, and dust cell deposition, along with emphysematous changes and 
bulla formation, consistent with CPFE. The purpose of this report is to increase 
pathologists' awareness of this complex disease and emphasize the importance of 
multidisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis and treatment of CPFE. 
Furthermore, this article encourages further research into CPFE.

BACKGROUND: Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) significantly impacts quality 
of life after rectal cancer surgery. Transanal irrigation (TAI) is a potential 
treatment, but long-term outcome data are limited. This study aims to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of TAI in LARS patients after more than 5 years of 
follow-up.
METHODS: From April 2015 to December 2019, consecutive patients with LARS 
following low anterior resection for rectal cancer, trained in TAI at Careggi 
University Hospital, were prospectively collected. Patients with LARS 
scores > 30 or those failing conservative management were included. TAI was 
performed using the Peristeen® device, with a standard protocol of 400-600 ml 
irrigation 3-4 times/week. Primary outcomes were maintenance of TAI benefits and 
patient satisfaction (VAS).
RESULTS: After an appropriate training and evaluation period, 35 patients were 
referred to TAI. While interruptions in the first year were mainly related to 
technical problems, ineffectiveness, or the onset of other clinical problems, 
afterward, patients tended to discontinue treatment only in the event of death 
(6 patients) or clinical well-being (5 patients). At the last follow-up control, 
with a median follow-up of 89 months, 15 patients (43%) still used TAI 
treatment. The median VAS satisfaction score for bowel control was 8.2.
CONCLUSIONS: TAI demonstrates sustained benefits in LARS patients over 5 years, 
with significant symptom improvement and high patient satisfaction. Further 
studies are needed to identify predictors of long-term success.

Obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS) is a condition that causes straining and 
may require manual evacuation and patients' thoughts circle around defecation 
impairing their quality of life. Mental comorbidity-related findings suggest a 
mental burden in ODS patients. In an observational cohort design, this study 
investigated the relationship between the mental distress and their clinical 
symptom severity for a group of patients with ODS who underwent surgical 
treatment. This study included 108 consecutive patients with ODS who were 
scheduled for laparoscopic resection rectopexy combined with pelvic floor 
repair, if indicated. Clinical symptom severity (Altomare score, rectal toxicity 
score, and Wexner incontinence score) and mental health scores (Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] and Personal Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) were 
assessed before and 6 months after surgery. Before surgery, 82.5% of patients 
had at least mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5), and 55.6% of patients 
had at least mild anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 5). The severity of the mental health 
scores correlated with the clinical symptom severity. At the 6-month follow-up, 
the bowel function scores improved significantly. Depression symptoms improved, 
whereas only slight changes in anxiety symptoms were observed. The improvement 
in clinical symptom severity correlated with better mental score results, 
whereas the severity of the preoperative mental distress did not influence the 
surgical or follow-up outcomes. Patients with obstructive defecation syndrome 
(ODS) experience significant depression and anxiety that adversely affect their 
quality of life. Surgical improvement of bowel function reduces depressive 
symptoms and, to a lesser extent, anxiety symptoms. Early multidisciplinary 
intervention should be considered for effective management. Future studies 
should further investigate mental distress caused by ODS symptoms or other 
underlying psychiatric comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of acupoint 
application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with Kangyou 
Decoction in patients with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection presenting with 
damp-heat syndrome obstructing the middle jiao.
METHODS: A total of 416 patients with Hp infection and TCM-defined damp-heat 
syndrome of the middle jiao were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment 
group (n = 208) or a control group (n = 208). The control group received 
standard bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, while the treatment group 
received acupoint application of TCM combined with oral administration of 
Kangyou Decoction. Both groups underwent treatment for two weeks. Outcomes 
included Hp eradication rates, changes in TCM syndrome scores pre- and 
post-treatment, and the incidence of adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Following two weeks of therapy, no statistically significant difference 
in Hp eradication rates was observed between the two groups (p > 0.05). Both 
groups demonstrated significant improvement in TCM syndrome scores (p < 0.05), 
with the treatment group showing a greater reduction compared to the control 
group (p < 0.05). The total effective rate in the treatment group was higher 
than that in the control group. Incidences of adverse reactions did not differ 
significantly between the groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Acupoint application combined with Kangyou Decoction yielded 
comparable Hp eradication outcomes to bismuth quadruple therapy in patients with 
damp-heat syndrome of the middle jiao. The combined therapy demonstrated greater 
improvement in clinical symptoms with a favorable safety profile, supporting its 
potential for clinical application.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with 
multiorgan involvement, being the development of neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms 
variable, in which the presentation of catatonia and Cotard syndrome (CoS) is 
rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 29-year-old woman who was diagnosed 
with SLE in 2018 based on the presence of articular, serosal and, hematological 
manifestations and immunological abnormalities. During her hospitalization, 
inappropriate behaviors including repetitive and incoherent speech, visual and 
olfactory hallucinations developed, so NP involvement was considered, and 
quetiapine and methylprednisolone pulses were administered with good response. 
The patient was discharged to the care of her family, being stuporous, 
bradypsychic, with thought blockages and nihilistic delusions; in consequence, 
she was diagnosed with Cotard syndrome (CoS). Moreover, she presented symptoms 
of catatonia including mutism, catalepsy and rigidity. Treatment consisted of 
diazepam, aripiprazole 30mg/day, fluoxetine 20mg/day and prednisone 60mg/day.
CONCLUSION: Catatonia can be a manifestation of NPSLE in active SLE. Catatonic 
symptoms and CoS in NPSLE have never been described. This is the first report of 
a SLE patient exhibiting CoS and catatonia.

Locomotive syndrome, characterized by impaired mobility owing to musculoskeletal 
disorders, poses a significant public health challenge, especially in aging 
populations. Locomotive syndrome limits physical activity, increases fall risk, 
leads to dependency, and diminishes quality of life. Effective interventions are 
urgently required. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the 
effectiveness of physical therapy in improving the symptoms of locomotive 
syndrome. A systematic evaluation of its effectiveness compared with other 
interventions is crucial for informing clinical practice and policy decisions. 
This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the PRISMA-P guidelines. 
Studies involving individuals diagnosed with locomotive syndrome, without 
restrictions on age, sex, or location, will be included. The reviewed 
interventions will include exercise programs, manual therapy, neuromuscular 
stimulation, and balance training, which will be compared with the absence of 
interventions or alternative therapies. The primary outcomes will include 
improvements in functional mobility and physical performance, symptom reduction, 
and the progression of locomotive syndrome. Secondary outcomes will include 
adherence to therapy, safety, quality of life, and psychological well-being. 
Randomized controlled and non-randomized controlled trials published in 
peer-reviewed journals will be searched in PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PEDro, 
Ichushi Web, and the Thai-Journal Citation Index Center, without language 
restrictions. Independent reviewers will perform data extraction and assess the 
risk of bias. A meta-analysis will be conducted using RevMan 5.4 software, with 
subgroup analyses to address heterogeneity. The Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to evaluate 
the certainty of evidence. This review aims to provide robust evidence on the 
effectiveness of physical therapy in managing locomotive syndrome and to 
potentially guide clinical practice and healthcare policy decisions.

OBJECTIVES: To improve functionality, quality of life, and exercise capacity in 
women who underwent breast cancer surgery and suffered axillary web syndrome 
(AWS) as a sequela.
DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial.
SETTING: Single-center study.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six post-breast cancer surgery patients with AWS had 
restricted functionality, quality of life, and exercise capacity.
INTERVENTIONS: Stretching combined with manual therapy and scar massage to 
release adhesion and lymphatic cord during 15 physiotherapy sessions of 
30-40 min each.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functionality was evaluated with DASH and Constant Scale, 
exercise capacity with IPAQ, and quality of life with EORTC QLQ-BR23. 
Participants were allocated to either intervention or control group using the 
Excel randomization tool. Blinding of the therapist was not possible due to the 
study's nature.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were assigned to the intervention group and 
twenty-three to the control group, becoming twenty-four and twenty-two, 
respectively, for analysis. Significant differences were detected in 
functionality and quality of life. The intervention effect varied over time with 
a 95% confidence interval (alpha 0.05) and a statistical power of 90% (beta 
0.1). Comparisons between groups showed significant differences in favor of the 
intervention group at 30, 60, and 90 days of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Stretching combined with scar massage and manipulative tissue 
release techniques improved functionality and quality of life in AWS patients. 
This physiotherapy technique could be considered the treatment of choice for 
this surgical sequela.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of personalized nursing based on the 
syndrome differentiation-based nursing model on clinical symptoms, treatment 
outcomes, hospital stay duration, and parental satisfaction in pediatric 
patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). A retrospective cohort 
design was employed, including 100 children hospitalized for URTI in the 
pediatric department of our hospital between January 2023 and June 2024. 
Patients were divided into an observation group (receiving individualized 
nursing based on the syndrome differentiation model) and a control group 
(receiving routine nursing care). The results revealed that the observation 
group had significantly shorter recovery times for fever, cough, appetite, 
mental state, and hospital stays compared to the control group (P < .05). No 
significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of 
complication rates or symptom relief (P > .05). Parental satisfaction was 
significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group 
(P < .05). The study suggests that personalized nursing based on the syndrome 
differentiation model effectively improves clinical symptom recovery, shortens 
hospital stays, and enhances parental satisfaction, showing promising clinical 
potential for widespread application in pediatric URTI care.

Medical University, Hefei, China.

RATIONALE: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a complex syndrome with high 
in-hospital mortality and the diagnosis and treatment of FES remain challenging. 
In this article, we present a case report as well as a comprehensive review of 
trauma-related cases to enhance the understanding of FES.
PATIENT CONCERNS: An 18-year-old young man developed a fever, tachycardia, and 
dyspnea about 58 hours after the trauma. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan 
revealed blizzard-like changes on lung window obviously different from the 
initial chest CT.
DIAGNOSES: The patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, and auxiliary 
examination results, especially the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid confirmed the 
diagnosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Chest CT scan demonstrated a significant absorption of the 
original lesions after the completion of methylprednisolone therapy for 3 days.
OUTCOMES: The patient was successfully discharged from the hospital without any 
complication.
LESSONS: When sudden dyspnea or altered consciousness arises, the possibility of 
FES should be taken into account. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can be 
helpful in diagnosing and assessing the severity of pulmonary embolism. 
Methylprednisolone can be employed in the treatment of FES while the 
complications should be considered.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a 
fundamental treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma despite its 
tendency to induce postembolization syndrome (PES), which can negatively impact 
the quality of life and treatment outcomes of patients. This study aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic dexamethasone in reducing PES following 
TACE.
METHODS: A thorough search across major databases was conducted to identify 
studies investigating the prophylactic use of dexamethasone in preventing and 
reducing PES. Efficacy was evaluated via a meta-analysis utilizing a 
random-effects model to determine the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs), focusing on PES symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, 
nausea, and vomiting.
RESULTS: Among 406 meticulously reviewed studies, 5, encompassing a patient 
cohort of 400 individuals, were included in the final analysis. The results 
revealed a significant reduction in the overall incidence of abdominal pain 
(RR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.51-0.75; P < 0.001), fever (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.60; 
P < 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (RR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43-0.76; P < 0.001) 
using dexamethasone prophylactically.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that the prophylactic administration of 
dexamethasone effectively prevents and reduces PES, significantly reducing the 
incidence of key symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and 
vomiting.

Postpneumonectomy syndrome (PPS) is a rare complication after pneumonectomy 
characterised by severe mediastinal shift leading to airway compression and 
respiratory distress. We present a case of a woman in her mid-40s who developed 
PPS following a right pneumonectomy for bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma. 
Surgical treatment of PPS had not previously been performed in Denmark by Danish 
surgeons, which is why we consulted with a British surgeon. The surgery was 
performed in Denmark.The procedure resulted in immediate respiratory 
improvement, and the patient was discharged 22 days postoperatively. Follow-up 
demonstrated sustained airway patency and no signs of cancer recurrence. This 
case highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of surgical management of PPS 
in centres with limited prior experience and supports mediastinal repositioning 
with prosthetic implants as a viable treatment option in severe cases.

BACKGROUND: Seventh-Day Syndrome (7DS) is one of the early serious complications 
after liver transplantation (LT) with rapid deterioration and high mortality. 
The pathogenesis of such rare cases has not been clarified and effective 
intervention measures are lacking. This study describes the entire diagnosis and 
treatment process of a highly suspected 7DS patient, who ultimately died due to 
liver failure. In the rapidly developing information age of technology, we 
recommend exploring potential independent risk factors and establishing 
effective warning models based on clinical information to assist in clinical 
decision-making.
METHODS: A 52-year-old patient with a recurrence of liver malignancy underwent 
LT after matching the liver source. The postoperative pathological results 
confirmed HCC and cirrhosis. Previous treatment history, test and examination 
results, surgical procedure, and postoperative treatments were evaluated 
comprehensively.
RESULTS: The patient initially recovered smoothly after surgery, but developed a 
fever on postoperative day 6. Subsequently, liver enzyme levels sharply 
increased, and anti-immune rejection therapy was ineffective. Ultrasound 
examination showed a significant decrease in portal vein velocity or even no 
blood flow signal. These were consistent with previously reported clinical 
manifestations and also conformed to the currently proposed mechanisms of immune 
damage and ischemic injury theory. Treatment of the 7DS included steroid pulse 
therapy, thymoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange therapy. 
Unfortunately, with the rapid and irreversible damage to the graft function 
leading to liver failure, the patient ultimately died due to no chance of 
retransplantation.
CONCLUSION: 7DS is a rare and highly lethal early serious complication after LT. 
Due to the unclear pathogenesis, rapid disease progression, and differences in 
cases, it presents significant challenges for prevention, diagnosis, and 
treatment. Utilizing big data analysis technology to identify potential risk 
factors and develop a warning system for the diagnosis and treatment of 7DS may 
enhance clinical decision-making in the future.

INTRODUCTION: Syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) refers to a 
group of recurrent fevers without a clear monogenic cause. Clinical spectrum, 
treatment response predictors and management strategies remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to longitudinally analyse a homogeneously selected 
cohort of 101 SURF patients, to identify factors associated with colchicine 
resistance and to evaluate the efficacy of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled in the Eurofever Registry, carefully excluding 
those with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical 
adenitis (PFAPA); familial Mediterranean fever and other known monogenic 
recurrent fevers. Demographic, clinical and treatment data were analysed to 
identify predictors of colchicine resistance and define subgroups through 
cluster analysis.
RESULTS: Common symptoms included fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain and myalgia, 
with PFAPA-like features (lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis, oral aphthae) observed 
in one-third of cases, sporadically. Colchicine efficacy, assessed in 77 
patients, revealed complete response in the majority of patients (61%). 
Univariable analysis identified PFAPA-like features, including aphthous 
stomatitis (p=0.001), cervical lymphadenopathy (p=0.012) and exudative 
tonsillitis (p=0.004), as associated with colchicine resistance. Multivariable 
analysis confirmed aphthous stomatitis as an independent predictor of resistance 
(p=0.014). Tonsillectomy was ineffective. IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, 
canakinumab) were beneficial in refractory cases. Cluster analysis revealed 
three distinct subgroups with varying symptoms and colchicine responses.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into SURF, identifying 
predictors of colchicine resistance and supporting the efficacy of IL-1 
blockade. Cluster analysis suggests the heterogeneity within SURF, reinforcing 
the need for refined diagnostic criteria and personalised treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Facial overfilled syndrome (FOS) is an increasingly recognized 
complication of injectable aesthetic procedures, characterized by undesirable 
facial volume and contour irregularities. While hyaluronidase is 
well-established for managing hyaluronic acid (HA) filler complications, 
treating FOS caused by non-HA fillers, such as fat and silicone, remains 
challenging.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the results of a novel enzymatic therapy 
combining hyaluronidase, collagenase, and lipase for treating FOS in five 
patients with complications from HA, fat, and silicone fillers. Additionally, we 
conducted a narrative literature review of studies published between 2015 and 
2024, focusing on FOS and its management.
METHODS: We performed a narrative literature review using PubMed and Google 
Scholar databases, identifying six key papers that specifically address FOS. 
Following this, we present a case series of five patients treated with a 
combination of 1.5 mL collagenase, 1.5 mL hyaluronidase (HASA), and 1.5 mL 
lipase (total volume: 4.5 mL). Enzymatic therapy was administered via cannula 
under ultrasound guidance, and outcomes were assessed through clinical 
evaluation and patient-reported satisfaction.
RESULTS: All five patients significantly improved facial volume and contour 
restoration after a single treatment session. The enzymatic combination 
effectively addressed complications from HA, fat, and silicone fillers, with no 
significant adverse events reported. Patient satisfaction improved 
significantly, highlighting the psychological benefits of the treatment.
CONCLUSION: Combining hyaluronidase, collagenase, and lipase represents a safe 
and effective approach for managing FOS caused by various filler types. Our 
study, supported by a narrative review of six key papers on FOS, underscores the 
importance of tailored enzymatic therapies in aesthetic medicine and calls for 
further research to optimize treatment protocols and expand the evidence base.

Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome in type 2 diabetes with diabetic 
ketoacidosis: A case report and literature review.

Xu M, Xia L, Xiao R, Deng D.

BACKGROUND: Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAS) is a rare allergic 
reaction triggered by exogenous insulin. It typically manifests as recurrent 
hypoglycemia during insulin use. In some cases, patients may also experience 
significant elevation in their blood glucose levels.
CASE REPORT: We review a case of type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by 
diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient exhibited a significant increase in his blood 
glucose level and demonstrated a substantial insulin resistance. Only through 
the administration of a large amount of insulin, it was possible to gradually 
reduce his blood glucose level. Notably, laboratory examination revealed a 
significant elevation in the patient's blood insulin autoantibody. Based on 
these findings, the patient was diagnosed with EIAS and used glucocorticoids 
during treatment. Subsequently, the patient's required insulin dose decreased 
significantly, and the blood glucose level was effectively controlled.
CONCLUSION: EIAS can significantly increase blood glucose levels and impair the 
hypoglycemic effect of insulin. In patients with acute metabolic disorders, such 
as ketoacidosis, glucocorticoid therapy can be considered.

Benign prostate syndrome (BPS) is one of the most common diseases in men. As a 
result of subvesical obstruction caused by the enlargement of the prostate, the 
function of the lower urinary tract is impaired. The symptoms of BPS are 
determined by the occurrence of voiding and bladder storage disorders. In 
addition to a patient's history and physical examination, the diagnosis also 
includes a sonographic examination of the urinary tract. Treatment should be 
symptom-focused and interdisciplinary. For medical treatment, a variety of 
different drugs are available, which are also used in general practice. For 
surgical therapy, various technologies are available which are selected 
depending on prostate volume, comorbidities and the patient's expectations. The 
following text provides an overview of the relevant aspects of BPS management.

EINLEITUNG: Das benigne Prostatasyndrom (BPS) ist eine der häufigsten 
Erkrankungen des Mannes. Infolge einer durch die Vergrösserung der Prostata 
bedingten subvesikalen Obstruktion kommt es zur Beeinträchtigung der Funktion 
des unteren Harntrakts. Die Symptome des BPS werden durch das Auftreten von 
Blasenentleerungs- und Blasenspeicherstörungen bestimmt. Die Diagnostik umfasst 
neben Anamnese und körperlicher Untersuchung auch eine sonographische 
Untersuchung des Harntrakts. Die Behandlung der Betroffenen sollte 
symptomfokussiert sowie interdisziplinär erfolgen. So stehen eine Vielzahl an 
unterschiedlichen medikamentösen Therapieoptionen zur Verfügung, die auch in der 
Hausarztpraxis Anwendung finden. Bei den operativen Therapien steht mittlerweile 
eine Vielzahl an Techniken zur Verfügung, die in Abhängigkeit von 
Prostatavolumen, Komorbiditäten sowie Erwartungen des Patienten ausgewählt 
werden. Der folgende Text gibt eine Übersicht über die relevanten Aspekte des 
BPS-Managements. Schlüsselwörter: Benignes Prostatasyndrom, benigne 
Prostatahyperplasie.

INTRODUCTION: Le syndrome bénin de la prostate (SBP) est l'une des maladies les 
plus courantes chez les hommes. En raison de l'obstruction sous-vésicale 
provoquée par l'hypertrophie de la prostate, la fonction des voies urinaires 
inférieures est altérée. Les symptômes sont déterminés par la survenue de 
troubles de la vidange et du stockage de la vessie. Outre l'anamnèse et l'examen 
physique, le diagnostic comprend également un examen échographique des voies 
urinaires. Le traitement des personnes concernées doit être axé sur les 
symptômes et interdisciplinaire. Il existe diverses options thérapeutiques 
médicamenteuses, qui sont également utilisées en médecine générale. Diverses 
techniques sont désormais disponibles pour les thérapies chirurgicales, 
sélectionnées en fonction du volume de la prostate, des comorbidités et des 
attentes du patient. Le texte suivant donne un aperçu des aspects pertinents de 
la gestion du BPS. Mots-clés: Syndrome bénin de la prostate, hyperplasie bénigne 
de la prostate.

The article presents data on febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) 
and describes a clinical case. FIRES starts with a refractory status epilepticus 
in the absence of an obvious acute disease or an apparent structural, metabolic, 
or toxic cause. The exact etiology of this syndrome remains unknown. Although 
the name implies an infectious etiology, the causative agent of the infection is 
generally not identified. Currently, there is no effective treatment or control 
for this condition since no approach has been proven effective enough in 
studies.

Publisher: В статье приводятся данные о синдроме эпилепсии, связанном с 
фебрильной инфекцией (англ.: Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome, 
FIRES), описывается клинический случай. Синдром FIRES дебютирует рефрактерным 
эпилептическим статусом при отсутствии явного острого заболевания или очевидной 
структурной, метаболической, токсической причины. Точная этиология этого 
синдрома так и остается неизвестной. Хотя название подразумевает инфекционную 
этиологию, возбудитель инфекции, как правило, не идентифицируется. На данный 
момент не существует эффективного лечения или контроля этого состояния, так как 
при исследованиях ни один подход не показал себя достаточно эффективным.

RATIONALE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are 
distinct autoimmune disorders whose concurrent presentation (overlap syndrome) 
poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While SLE-associated 
liver involvement is recognized, true SLE-AIH overlap is rare and lacks 
established management guidelines. This report details the successful management 
of such a case to contribute insights into this complex clinical scenario.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 35-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of 
intermittent facial and body rashes accompanied by significant weight loss 
(approximately 10 kg). Over the preceding half-month, he developed signs of 
liver injury, including fatigue, cold intolerance, loss of appetite, and 
generalized weakness.
DIAGNOSES: Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, cutaneous manifestations: facial 
and generalized skin rash, hematologic abnormalities: cytopenia, including 
serological testing (positive antinuclear antibody [1:1000], anti-SS-A 
antibodies, elevated immunoglobulin G, rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, decreased complement C3 and C4 levels), 
liver function tests (persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, globulin), 
and imaging (uneven liver texture/density on ultrasound/computed tomography), 
confirmed a diagnosis of SLE complicated by AIH. The diagnosis of SLE meets both 
the 1997 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and the 2012 
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics revised criteria. AIH 
diagnosis was supported by both the 1990 (score=16) and 2008 (score=7) 
International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) scoring systems. Infectious and 
other common causes of liver injury were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: Initial management focused on controlling liver injury using 
intravenous and oral hepatoprotective agents (inosine, bicyclol, silibinin, 
compound glycyrrhizin, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate). High-dose intravenous 
glucocorticoids (dexamethasone 5-10 mg daily) were initiated concurrently to 
suppress autoimmune activity. Upon stabilization of liver function, treatment 
transitioned to oral prednisone (30 mg daily) combined with the 
immunosuppressant leflunomide (10 mg daily). Glucocorticoids were subsequently 
tapered strictly according to plan, while leflunomide monotherapy was maintained 
long-term. Adjunctive therapies included calcium and gastric protection.
OUTCOMES: Liver function tests normalized following the combined 
hepatoprotective and glucocorticoid therapy. The introduction and maintenance of 
leflunomide, alongside glucocorticoid tapering, effectively controlled SLE 
disease activity. At a 2-year follow-up, the patient remained clinically stable 
with normalized liver function, no recurrence of severe symptoms, and a good 
quality of life.
LESSONS: This case highlights the efficacy of a sequential treatment approach 
combining glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants (specifically leflunomide) for 
managing SLE-AIH overlap syndrome. Early diagnosis using established criteria is 
crucial. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential. Long-term leflunomide 
monotherapy demonstrated sustained remission in this patient, although vigilance 
for adverse effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity) and disease flare is necessary. The 
absence of specific guidelines for this overlap syndrome underscores the need 
for individualized treatment strategies based on SLE and AIH management 
principles.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in multiple myeloma 
(MM) can cause engraftment syndrome (ES), a clinical diagnosis without specific 
laboratory biomarkers. Herein, six cytokines commonly elevated during 
transplantation were chronologically detected during ASCT in 96 patients with 
newly diagnosed MM, 24.0 % of whom experienced ES. Among the molecules 
demonstrating remarkable peak levels, only IL-5 was able to differentiate ES 
from non-ES. IL-5 measured on day 12 emerged as an optimal indicator of ES, and 
its diagnostic value was enhanced when combined with the proportion of 
endogenous CD8+ T cells after engraftment and daratumumab-naive history. 
Notably, IL-5 levels on day 6 (IL-5 D6) served as the earliest predictor. 70.8 % 
of the patients could be predicted as having ES or non-ES via the IL-5 D6 cutoff 
value and daratumumab treatment history. It suggests that IL-5 can aid in 
estimating ES, and prior exposure to daratumumab may reduce the incidence of ES.

This systematic review aimed to present the main clinical, diagnostic and 
therapeutic aspects of Mauriac syndrome, which is a rare syndrome that mainly 
affects children and adolescents with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
This review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42024531249). The following databases were used in our search: PubMed, 
Lilacs and Scielo, on 04/02/2024. Studies that presented any data on patients 
with Mauriac syndrome were included, however, review studies, letters to the 
editor and animal studies were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using a 
specific method for case reports. To analyze the results, the general, clinical, 
diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics were analyzed using a qualitative 
analysis. A total of 24 studies were included, 18 case reports and 6 case 
series. The patients' mean age was 16.26 years, and the mean glycated hemoglobin 
was 12.93%. The main signs and symptoms reported were hepatomegaly (88%), short 
stature (52%), cushingoid features (35%) and abdominal discomfort (26%). The 
means of AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, triglycerides 
and lactate were above the reference value. Some studies used abdominal 
ultrasound (US), abdominal computed tomography (CT) or liver biopsy to make the 
diagnosis. CT and US showed hepatomegaly, while liver biopsies showed glycogen 
accumulation in hepatocytes. Treatment in most studies was based on improving 
blood glucose levels and diet. Therefore, Mauriac syndrome has diverse symptoms. 
Lab test and imaging modalities can be useful to establish diagnosis.

Pediatric Bronchiolitis Obliterans and Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome: 
Nursing Considerations.

Deffler J(1).

Author information:
(1)Jared Deffler is a nurse practitioner in the cardiac intensive care unit at 
the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is an 
irreversible, obstructive lung disease characterized by the narrowing of 
bronchioles by lung fibrosis, inflammation, and scarring.
OBJECTIVE: To provide acute care, transplant, and critical care nurses a summary 
of the disease process, causes, and treatment options for bronchiolitis 
obliterans in pediatric patients to promote early recognition of signs in 
at-risk patients.
METHODS: This descriptive literature review was limited to articles published in 
2013 or later. Searches of the PubMed and CINAHL databases using the terms 
bronchiolitis obliterans and pediatric yielded 432 articles. Of these articles, 
22 were used for this review. The Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice 
appraisal tool was used to assess levels of evidence and methodologic quality of 
the articles.
RESULTS: Patients in 3 main groups are at risk for bronchiolitis obliterans: 
those who have had respiratory infection, those who have received lung 
transplant, and those who have received stem cell transplant.
DISCUSSION: A diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans requires lung biopsy and 
histopathology. For patients who are unable to undergo biopsy or whose biopsy 
results are inconclusive, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome can be clinically 
identified with spirometry (forced expiratory volume in first second of 
expiration and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity) 
and high-resolution computed tomography. Systemic corticosteroids are often the 
first-line treatment; second-line strategies are under investigation.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of risk factors, signs, and current treatments for 
bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome can help acute care 
and critical care nurses decelerate progression of the disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an updated overview of the association 
between chronic urticaria (CU) and autoinflammatory syndromes (AS), underlining 
the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of identifying CU as an initial 
manifestation of systemic autoinflammatory disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: emerging evidence has reinforced the role of innate immune 
dysregulation in the pathogenesis of CU associated with AS, with particular 
involvement of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β. 
Several monogenic and multifactorial autoinflammatory diseases, including 
cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Schnitzler syndrome (SchS), 
Still's disease (SD), and others, may present with CU. Neutrophilic urticarial 
dermatosis (NUD) has been recognized as a histopathological hallmark. Early 
diagnosis remains challenging but is crucial, as targeted therapies, especially 
IL-1 inhibitors, have demonstrated significant efficacy in controlling systemic 
inflammation and preventing disease progression.
SUMMARY: CU refractory to conventional treatment, particularly when associated 
with systemic symptoms, should prompt suspicion of an underlying 
autoinflammatory syndrome. A comprehensive diagnostic approach, including 
clinical assessment, inflammatory markers evaluation, histopathological 
examination, and genetic testing, is essential. Recognition of the 
autoinflammatory nature of CU allows for timely initiation of personalized 
therapies, improving patient prognosis and reducing long-term morbidity.

Passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS) is a hematological complication that can 
occur following transplantation, characterized by donor-derived memory B 
lymphocytes producing antibodies against the recipient's blood cells. This 
review examines the pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and treatment 
strategies aimed at enhancing clinical management and standardizing therapeutic 
protocols for PLS. A literature search was conducted using Web of Science and 
PubMed to identify relevant publications on PLS, resulting in 79 studies. 
Studies were selected based on predefined criteria, including a focus on human 
donor-derived alloimmunity, documented blood group antigen-antibody 
interactions, transplantation context, clinical data on outcomes or management, 
and methodological validity. Only studies containing actual patient data and 
substantive discussions about PLS were included. PLS commonly presents as 
hemolytic anemia, accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, 
indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and reduced haptoglobin levels. Diagnosis is 
primarily based on clinical manifestations and laboratory tests, including the 
direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and antibody screening. Differential diagnosis is 
crucial for excluding drug-induced hemolytic anemia and thrombotic 
microangiopathy. Current treatment strategies for PLS focus on halting hemolysis 
and restoring hematological balance. First-line treatment includes 
donor-compatible red blood cell transfusions and high-dose corticosteroids, 
while refractory cases may necessitate rituximab or plasmapheresis. Despite 
advancements in PLS management, challenges persist, including delayed diagnosis 
due to self-limiting cases and a lack of standardized treatment protocols. 
Future research should incorporate genomic and proteomic biomarkers for accurate 
diagnosis and risk prediction. Developing mechanism-driven therapies targeting 
donor lymphocytes and establishing global consensus frameworks can enhance 
monitoring, improve graft survival, and optimize transplant recipient outcomes.

PURPOSE: Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS), a frequent postoperative 
complication of rectal resection, has been shown to significantly impact 
patients' quality of life. Electroacupuncture (EA), a non-pharmaceutical 
treatment, ameliorates gastrointestinal symptoms and promotes bowel movement. 
However, high-quality clinical evidence is lacking. This study aimed to 
determine whether EA can improve LARS symptoms compared with sham 
electroacupuncture (SA).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled clinical 
trial will be carried out across the outpatient clinics of three tertiary 
medical centers in China. A total of 136 patients with LARS who meet the 
inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated, in equal proportions (1:1), to 
either the EA or SA group. Each patient will undergo treatment three times 
weekly during the first four weeks and twice-weekly sessions over the subsequent 
four weeks. After the intervention, a 24-week follow-up period will be 
conducted. The primary outcome is the change in the LARS score from baseline to 
the end of week 8. Secondary outcomes include changes in the LARS score at other 
time points, response rate of patients showing reduced defecation dysfunction, 
subjective distress related to intestinal symptoms, Wexner Diarrhea score, 
Bristol Bowel Diary, EORTC-QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire, and Fecal 
Incontinence Quality of Life Scale.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of EA from multiple perspectives, 
investigate its potential application in LARS after rectal cancer surgery, and 
guide the development of therapy tailored to meet specific individual health 
needs.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the 
Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (No. 2024BZYLL0402). 
All participants enrolled in the trial will provide written informed consent 
prior to randomization. Results will be prepared for submission to a 
peer-reviewed academic journal.

Chronic back pain is commonly attributed to musculoskeletal or spinal issues, 
but rarer conditions like twelfth rib syndrome can often be overlooked, leading 
to ineffective treatments. This case presents a male in his 50s with persistent 
left-sided flank pain, initially attributed to low back pain and degenerative 
disc disease. Despite conservative treatments, his symptoms persisted, prompting 
further investigation. A physical examination revealed localised tenderness over 
the twelfth rib, and a trigger-point injection provided immediate pain relief, 
confirming the diagnosis of twelfth rib syndrome. Differential diagnoses, 
including musculoskeletal pain, slipping rib syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, 
pleuritis, renal pathology and costochondritis, were considered but ruled out. 
The patient's treatment involved trigger-point injections and physical therapy, 
resulting in significant symptom improvement. This case emphasises the 
importance of considering twelfth rib syndrome in patients with unexplained 
flank pain, especially when standard treatments fail and highlights the role of 
targeted interventions in improving patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy in treating various types of 
chronic pain conditions. A double-blind clinical trial was conducted to assess 
the effectiveness and tolerability of duloxetine compared to amitriptyline in 
women suffering from chronic pelvic pain (CPP) syndrome.
METHODS: Sixty-nine eligible women diagnosed with CPP syndrome were randomly 
assigned to receive either duloxetine or amitriptyline. Duloxetine was initiated 
at 30 mg/day and amitriptyline at 25 mg/day, with dosages increased to 60 mg/day 
for duloxetine and 50 mg/day for amitriptyline after the first week and 
maintained throughout weeks 2 to 8 of the treatment phase. The effectiveness of 
the treatment was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Chronic 
Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) and its domain scores at weeks 4 and 8 
after treatment. The safety and tolerability of the study medications were 
assessed using an antidepressant side effect checklist and spontaneous 
participant reports of adverse effects. All analyses were conducted on an 
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) analysis data set.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing both medications experienced similar improvements 
in their total NIH-CPSI scores at weeks 4 and 8. The proportions of patients 
achieving a response, defined as at least a 6-point reduction in the total 
NIH-CPSI score at both weeks 4 and 8, were also comparable between the 
duloxetine and amitriptyline treatments. Further, at the end of the study 
period, a similar proportion of subjects reported marked or moderate overall 
symptom improvements with both treatments. However, in the analysis of NIH-CPSI 
domain scores, duloxetine-treated patients exhibited lower pain domain scores at 
both study endpoints, while amitriptyline-treated patients achieved better 
scores in the urinary symptoms domain. Regarding quality of life domain scores, 
no significant differences were observed between the groups. In terms of safety 
and tolerability, duloxetine demonstrated more favorable outcomes, with fewer 
patients experiencing adverse effects and a lower withdrawal rate due to adverse 
effects compared to amitriptyline.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that duloxetine is as effective as 
amitriptyline for managing CPP syndrome in women, with the added advantage of a 
more favorable safety profile.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical 
Trials (identifier code: IRCT20120215009014N457). Registration date: 2023-01-10.

BACKGROUND: Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) is a debilitating condition 
post-surgery, requiring long-term management.
AIM: To evaluate the benefits of long-term transanal irrigation (TAI) treatment 
(up to 24 months) for LARS patients.
METHODS: A multicenter study across 13 centers included 159 patients to assess 
satisfaction with TAI for bowel control and quality of life (QoL). Secondary 
objectives included evaluating symptom improvement, dropout rates, and TAI 
characteristics (frequency, water volume, duration). Validated questionnaires 
were administered at baseline (T0) and after 1 (T1), 6 (T6), 12 (T12), and 24 
(T24) months. Statistical analyses included signed rank sum tests for score 
differences, F-tests for symptom frequency, mixed-effects models for LARS 
category changes.
RESULTS: TAI significantly improved satisfaction and QoL (p < 0.001). At T0, 
84.8 % of patients had major LARS, decreasing to 16.5 % at T24. Mean LARS score 
improved by 19.8 ± 12.3 points from baseline to T24, showing a sustained and 
significant long-term improvement (p < 0.001). Symptom frequency decreased from 
4.3 events per patient at T0 to 0.5 at T24 (p < 0.001). Dropouts occurred in 5 
(11.4 %) cases by T6, 9 (6.8 %) by T12, and 12 (8.9 %) by T24.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed for the first time that long-term TAI treatment 
benefits LARS patients by improving symptoms, satisfaction, and QoL, with 
effects sustained over 24 months.

BACKGROUND: 5 years have passed since the formation of the multidisciplinary 
consortium 'Knowing & Treating Kosaki and Penttinen Syndromes', two ultra-rare 
degenerative multisystem syndromes caused by heterozygous activating variants in 
PDGFRB. Neurological, orthopaedic and vascular deterioration can occur. Case 
reports of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) suggest that 
these drugs may be a therapeutic option in the future. The bi-annual remote 
meetings provide an opportunity to share knowledge on these syndromes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The consortium has validated the communication process, 
standardised follow-up guidelines, established a database to improve the natural 
history of these syndromes and evaluated the real-world safety and efficacy 
profile of TKIs by comparing treated and untreated patients. The regulatory 
framework is in place.
RESULTS: As of November 2024, 18 teams in 13 countries have joined the 
consortium. More than 25 patients have been identified worldwide, either 
published or unpublished; 7 of them were treated with a TKI. The guidelines 
include retrospective and prospective sections for each organ affected by the 
disease and are based on literature and expert opinion. They also include 
recommendations to standardise the assessment of the efficacy and safety of 
treatments prescribed under compassionate use.
CONCLUSION: The consortium welcomes new teams on an ongoing basis. 
Recommendations are especially useful in such ultra-rare degenerative diseases. 
The real-life observational study seems to be an appropriate model to improve 
knowledge, including the assessment of treatment efficacy when the prevalence of 
the disease does not allow the setting up of clinical trials.

Author information:
(1)Barbara Cordell is an adjunct professor of nursing at Panola College in 
Carthage, TX. She is president of Auto-Brewery Syndrome Information and Research 
(ABSIR), a nonprofit advocacy group for patients with auto-brewery syndrome 
(ABS), and has authored a book on ABS that is featured on the ABSIR website. The

potential conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise.

Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS), also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is an 
underdiagnosed condition caused by an over-colonization of fermenting organisms 
in the gastrointestinal tract. These organisms-yeasts and, more recently 
recognized, bacteria-ferment carbohydrates into alcohol. The result is 
intoxication when not drinking, which may be accompanied by safety issues and 
even legal ramifications. If a patient with ABS is not treated, there may be 
adverse physical, social, psychological, and quality-of-life consequences. This 
article describes ABS presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up and the 
nursing implications for the care of patients wherever they are encountered. 
Through evidence-based nursing practice, people affected by ABS can begin to 
heal their gastrointestinal system. Nurses can educate patients and help them 
manage medications, diet, and lifestyle choices.

OBJECTIVE: Assess survival outcomes and risk of recurrence in vaginal estrogen 
therapy (VET) users with medical history of breast cancer.
DATA SOURCE: The search strategy was guided by standardized terms and keywords 
were identified from controlled vocabularies. Following databases were used for 
literature search: Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Only 
studies published in the 21st century (2001-present) and written in English were 
included.
STUDY SELECTION: A total of 988 records were reviewed by two independent 
authors. After full-text analysis of 38 of them, 7 articles were included in the 
meta-analysis.
DATA COLLECTION: Data from eligible studies were extracted and tabulated based 
on predefined criteria: author, country, year, study type, sample size, type of 
intervention, use of aromatase inhibitors, duration of follow-up, and main 
outcomes.
RESULTS: 118.659 breast cancer survivors were analyzed, of whom 6.358 were 
treated with VET. The overall analysis showed no significant increase in the 
risk of recurrence (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.67-1.11). VET users had a significant 
reduction in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.80, IC95%: 0.75-0,86).
CONCLUSION: Vaginal estrogen therapy appears to be safe in the management of 
menopausal genitourinary syndrome in breast cancer survivors and it is related 
to significantly lower all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of 
patients with obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly 
(OHVIRA)/Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich (HWW) syndrome and to evaluate the efficacy of 
minimally invasive management strategies.
METHODS: This cohort study involved a retrospective review of the medical 
records of patients diagnosed with OHVIRA/ HWW syndrome. Data on chief 
complaints, diagnostic findings, associated complications, anatomical 
variations, and therapeutic interventions were extracted.
RESULTS: A total of nine cases were eventually included. The mean age of symptom 
onset was 23.1 years, whereas the mean age at diagnosis was 20.3 years. Six 
patients (67%) were diagnosed with OHVIRA syndrome, and an equal proportion 
(67%) had left-sided abnormalities. Therapeutic interventions were performed in 
five cases (56%). Statistically, diagnosis after menarche and severe 
dysmenorrhea was positively correlated with therapeutic interventions (p = 0.048 
and p = 0.040, respectively). In one case, symptoms appeared after amenorrhea 
due to pregnancy, leading to a first-time diagnosis of HWW syndrome in the 
patient. Management strategies included traditional transvaginal surgery in 
three patients, vaginoscopic surgery in one patient, and hormone therapy without 
surgical intervention in another.
CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis before menarche reduces the risk of therapeutic 
intervention, while severe dysmenorrhea is a risk factor for therapeutic 
interventions. Amenorrhea due to pregnancy can result in the re-closure of a 
pre-existing communicating tract. Minimally invasive management approaches, such 
as hormone therapy without surgery or vaginoscopic incision, can be effective.

BACKGROUND: Quantitative attempts to improve syndrome specificity typically 
produce large heterogenous subgroupings, impacting the validity of treatment and 
research targets. Assessing barriers to the valid application of existing 
methods and examining improvements from an interpretable projection-based 
clustering alternative may improve the precision and reproducibility of our 
research targets and classification systems.
METHODS: This exploratory, cross-sectional, study recruited 2820 participants 
aged 12-to-25 years, from primary-healthcare services in Australia, between 
November 2018 and July 2023. 1843 participants completed relevant self-reported 
measures of depression, anxiety and mania-like experiences, and were included 
for analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to examine the 
distribution of within-syndrome variance. Projection-based subtypes were 
compared to traditional quantitative phenotyping approaches: clustering 
paradigms (Model-Based, Centre-Based Partition, Hierarchical), LCA, and 
Exploratory Factor Analysis (FA).
RESULTS: Interpretable projection-based clustering improved homogeneity and 
qualitative distinctions between clusters were compared to all other methods. 
This identified 14 clusters organisable into six novel symptom profiles: sleep 
(n = 117; 11 %), mania (n = 125; 12 %), anxiety (n = 119; 11 %), weight/appetite 
gain (n = 138; 13 %), weight/appetite loss (n = 242; 23 %), and an 
undifferentiated type (n = 310; 29 %). The PCA identified a skewed power-law 
distribution underlying symptom variance, affecting standard LCA/clustering 
procedures. This interacted with optimisation algorithms, producing heterogenous 
subtypes. Within FA, it produced the nested hierarchical structure identified in 
HiTOP studies.
CONCLUSIONS: A skewed variance distribution underlying the depressive syndrome 
adversely impacts standard Clustering/LCA methods, and may contribute to past 
difficulties in identifying well-specified data-driven phenotypes. Consequently, 
future studies should consider the distribution's impact to their optimisation 
algorithms or use the better-specified projection-based clustering. Identified 
profiles reflect major trends in depressive symptom expression, potentially 
representing improved research targets.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and 
the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite medical 
advances, approximately 80% of all rectal cancer survivors develop low anterior 
resection syndrome. Although transanal irrigation holds promise against low 
anterior resection syndrome, existing evidence is inconclusive. In this study, 
we evaluated the efficacy and safety of transanal irrigation in managing low 
anterior resection syndrome.
METHODS: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Chinese Electronic Periodical 
Services, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched for studies on 
transanal irrigation.
RESULTS: Six studies involving 258 patients were included. Transanal irrigation 
significantly mitigated bowel symptom severity within 3, 6, and 12 months of 
treatment, with mean differences (95% confidence intervals) of -14.22 (-20.07 to 
-8.38, I2 = 30%), -11.44 (-15.88 to -7.01, I2 = 0%), and -9.01 (-13.01 to -5.02, 
I2 = 0%), respectively. Transanal irrigation also significantly reduced fecal 
incontinence within 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment, with standardized mean 
differences (95% confidence intervals) of -0.91 (-1.59 to -0.23), -0.72 (-1.32 
to -0.13, I2 = 19%), and -0.64 (-1.14 to -0.14, I2 = 0%), respectively. No 
significant between-group difference was observed in treatment satisfaction 
(mean difference: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: -0.41 to 2.65, I2 = 28%) or 
quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Transanal irrigation may offer short-term relief from low anterior 
resection syndrome symptoms after rectal cancer surgery, although its effects 
may diminish over time. However, it does not significantly contribute to quality 
of life or treatment satisfaction. Further research is required to determine the 
long-term outcomes of transanal irrigation.

BACKGROUND: Syndrome differentiation in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an 
ancient principle that guides disease diagnosis and treatment. Among these, the 
cold and hot syndromes play a crucial role in identifying the nature of the 
disease and guiding the treatment of viral pneumonia. However, differentiating 
between cold and hot syndromes is often considered esoteric. Machine learning 
offers a promising avenue for clinicians to identify these syndromes more 
accurately, thereby supporting more informed clinical decision-making in the 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct a diagnostic model for differentiating 
cold and hot syndromes in viral pneumonia by integrating TCM and modern medical 
features using machine learning methods.
METHODS: The application of 8 machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting 
machine [GBM], logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting 
[XGB], light gradient boosting machine [LGB], ridge regression, least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator, and support vector machine) generated and 
validated (both internally and externally) a model for differentiating cold and 
hot syndromes in viral pneumonia, based on clinical data from 1484 patient 
samples collected at 2 medical centers between 2021 and 2022.
RESULTS: The GBM model, which combines TCM and modern medicine features, 
outperformed models using only TCM features or only modern medicine features in 
distinguishing cold and hot syndromes in patients with viral pneumonia. The 
optimal discrimination model comprised 13 optimal features (temperature, red 
cell distribution width-SD, creatinine, total bilirubin, globulin, C-reactive 
protein, unconjugated bilirubin, white blood cell, neutrophil percentage, 
aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, thrombocytocrit, 
and age) and the GBM algorithm, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.7788. Under internal and external testing, the AUCs were 0.7645 and 0.8428, 
respectively. Moreover, significant differences were observed between the cold 
and hot syndrome groups in temperature (P=.02), red cell distribution width-SD 
(P<.001), neutrophil percentage (P=.01), total cholesterol (P=.003), 
thrombocytocrit (P<.001), and age (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This pioneering study integrates the theory of TCM cold and hot 
syndromes with modern laboratory-based tests through machine learning. The 
developed model offers a novel approach for differentiating cold and hot 
syndromes in viral pneumonia, enabling practitioners to identify the syndrome 
quickly and efficiently, thereby supporting more informed clinical 
decision-making. Additionally, this research provides new insights into the 
modernization and scientific interpretation of TCM syndrome differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (KTSZ) is a rare, autosomal recessive 
neurodegenerative disorder. Patients suffer from a triad of developmental 
delays, epilepsy, and amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). Most reports of KTSZ 
patients focus on the genetic pattern of the disease and medical features, 
dental care is not considered a primary part of the initial intervention. Thus, 
the aim of the current work was to evaluate the impact that dental treatment 
plans had on both patients and caregivers.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a series of five pediatric patients, aged 4-14 
years, and diagnosed with KTSZ. All patients were from Druze origin and carried 
the same ROGDI gene mutation. Patients were suffering from oral and dental 
disease due to a lack of prior dental treatment as well as dental manifestations 
of KTSZ and AI in the form of delayed eruption, small teeth, and yellowish 
discoloration with hypoplastic enamel. Patients were referred to the Department 
of Pediatric Dentistry at the Galilee Medical Center and underwent dental 
treatment under general anesthesia (GA) which included both periodontal and 
prosthodontic treatment. Post-operatively, patient sreturned for routine 
follow-up visits every three months to maintain oral hygiene and provide 
preventive dental care. To assess the impact of dental interventions under GA on 
the patients' and their legal guardians, The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact 
Scale (ECOHIS) was completed by guardians to two months before and two months 
after dental treatment. Reports indicated a clear improvement both in patients 
and family domains of ECOHIS post-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive dental treatment under GA significantly improved KTSZ 
patients symptoms and functions, as well as parent distress.

Laparoscopic treatment of Rapunzel syndrome - a case report and literature 
review.

[Article in English]

Szarzec J, Žatecký J, Krauzová K, Peteja M.

The case report describes a rare case of the cause of abdominal pain and 
palpable resis-tance in the epigastric region. A CT scan of the abdomen was 
performed with a surprising cause of the trouble - a trichobezoar filling the 
stomach, also described as Rapunzel syndrome, i.e. Goldilocks syndrome. Upon 
further questioning, the patient's mother retrospectively admits her daughter's 
pulling out her own hair (trichotillomania) and eating it (trichophagia) since 
the age of four. The finding was consulted, and could not be removed by 
gastroscopy due to its size. A successful laparoscopic gastrotomy with total 
extraction of the trichobezoar was performed. The child recovered without 
complications. A psychiatric evaluation was performed and the child was 
discharged home on the 10th postoperative day.

Lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disease which frequently involves the skin. 
There are several variants of cutaneous lupus, which are defined and classified 
by the location and the depth of the inflammatory infiltrate, adnexal 
involvement, presence or absence of interphase dermatitis, and chronology (1). 
The most common clinical subtypes are acute, subacute and chronic cutaneous 
lupus erythematosus; however, other rare specific and non-specific cutaneous 
involvements also exist (2). Rowell syndrome is one of these rare specific 
variants and was originally described as the association of lupus erythematosus, 
erythema multiforme-like lesions without any known precipitating factors, and 
immunological abnormalities such as a speckled pattern of antinuclear antibody 
(ANA) staining, positive Anti-La antibody, and reactive rheumatoid factor (3). 
Subsequently, in order to enhance diagnostic specificity, the criteria were 
redefined as major (lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme-like lesions, 
speckled pattern of ANA staining) and minor (chilblains, positive Anti-La or 
Anti-Ro antibodies, reactive rheumatoid factor); patients should present all 
three major criteria plus at least one minor criterion to be diagnosed with 
Rowell syndrome (4). First line treatment options for cutaneous lupus as well 
for Rowell syndrome comprise topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, 
systemic anti-malarial therapy, and systemic corticosteroids (for active 
disease). In anti-malarial resistant disease, retinoids, dapsone, methotrexate, 
and other systemic immunosuppressive agents can be considered, though with a 
lower level of evidence (5). Herein, we present the case of a patient with 
Rowell syndrome with a therapeutic approach that is rarely included in the 
literature. Informed consent was obtained and signed from the patient regarding 
the use of the patient's information for the purposes of writing a case report 
publication. A 38-year-old woman who had been examined by the Rheumatology 
Department for connective tissue disease (CTD) because of her morning stiffness 
and peripheral arthritis was referred to us for consultation due to the new 
onset of a mild, itchy rash. The patient's lesions first appeared on her face, 
neck and upper trunk, subsequently becoming generalized. There was no previous 
history of recent infection or medication. The patient underwent follow-up under 
hydroxychloroquine therapy (400 mg/day) for CTD for 2 months. Dermatological 
physical examination showed violaceous-dark erythematous plaques with a 
prominent arcuate/targetoid shape at the periphery were present on her whole 
body, with oral mucosal erosions (Figure 1). In previous laboratory studies, ANA 
positivity with a speckled pattern and Anti-Ro positivity were observed. 
Rheumatoid factor was non-reactive. A punch biopsy was performed. 
Histopathological examination showed prominent interface dermatitis with basal 
vacuolar degeneration and apoptotic keratinocytes, which corresponds to subacute 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Due to the presence of three major criteria and 
one minor criterion, the patient was diagnosed with Rowell syndrome. She was 
given additional treatment comprising 1 mg/kg/day oral methylprednisolone. 
However cutaneous involvement progressed rapidly, and the methylprednisolone 
dose was increased to 500 mg/day intravenously for three consecutive days as 
pulse steroid therapy. Thereafter, upon clinical irresponsiveness, oral 
cyclosporine was started at 3.5 mg/kg/day, and systemic corticosteroid therapy 
was gradually ceased. An excellent and complete clinical response was achieved 
at the fourth week of the cyclosporine treatment (Figure 2). Cyclosporine is a 
rapid-acting immunosuppressive agent which inhibits calcineurin and blocks 
T-lymphocyte response (5). Just one Rowell syndrome case treated with 
cyclosporine has been reported so far in the literature (6). Even though 
cyclosporine therapy is not suggested for cutaneous lupus erythematosus without 
systemic involvement (4), it can considered as a treatment method due to its 
rapid and dramatic effectiveness, especially in cases that do not respond to 
steroids while presenting with rapid progression.

GIGYF2 (Grb10-interacting GYF protein 2) functions as a versatile adaptor 
protein that regulates gene expression at various levels. At the transcriptional 
level, GIGYF2 facilitates VCP/p97-mediated extraction of ubiquitylated Rpb1 from 
stalled RNA polymerase II complexes during DNA damage response. In mRNA 
surveillance, GIGYF2 participates in ribosome collision-induced quality control, 
nonsense-mediated decay, no-go decay, and non-stop decay pathways. Furthermore, 
GIGYF2 interacts with key factors including 4EHP, TTP, CCR4-NOT, DDX6, ZNF598, 
and TNRC6A to mediate translational repression and mRNA degradation. 
Additionally, dysregulation of GIGYF2 has been implicated in various 
pathological conditions, including metabolic diseases, vascular aging, viral 
infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the 
structural and functional characteristics of GIGYF2, highlighting its importance 
in transcriptional regulation, mRNA surveillance, translational inhibition, and 
mRNA degradation, while also elucidating its potential as a therapeutic target 
for disease treatment.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether anterior uveitis developing after BNT162b2 
COVID-19 vaccination-classified as Autoimmune/Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by 
Adjuvants (ASIA)-exhibits distinct clinical features compared to idiopathic 
uveitis.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed records of patients 
diagnosed with non-infectious anterior uveitis between June 1, 2021, and 
December 31, 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: post-vaccine 
ASIA-related uveitis (Group 1) and idiopathic uveitis (Group 2).
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included: 12 in Group 1 and 50 in Group 2. 
The mean age was similar (33.8 ± 10.4 vs. 35.1 ± 10.8 years; p = 0.547), with 
male predominance in both groups (61.1% vs. 58.5%). Group 1 had significantly 
milder anterior chamber inflammation (1.94 ± 0.64 vs. 2.85 ± 0.94; p < 0.001) 
and fewer ocular complications (16.7% vs. 60.0%; p = 0.003). All Group 1 cases 
responded to topical corticosteroids alone, while 32.3% in Group 2 required 
systemic immunosuppressants (p = 0.004). Best corrected visual acuity improved 
in both groups over time, but recovery was faster and more complete in Group 1 
(p < 0.001 for time × group interaction).
CONCLUSION: Anterior uveitis associated with ASIA syndrome post-vaccination 
appears to follow a milder, self-limiting course, with better visual outcomes 
and less aggressive treatment needs than idiopathic uveitis. These findings 
offer important insight into the clinical behavior of vaccine-associated ocular 
inflammation.

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) 
syndrome is the most frequent periodic fever syndrome in non-Mediterranean 
children, usually manifesting before the age of 5 years. It is characterized by 
clockwork episodes of fever lasting 3-7 days, accompanied by aphthous 
stomatitis, pharyngitis, and/or cervical adenitis. Typically, patients with 
PFAPA are generally well between episodes and exhibit normal growth and 
development. Although PFAPA often resolves spontaneously, its recurrent nature 
can significantly impact quality of life, and symptoms may persist into 
adulthood. This narrative review aimed to consolidate current knowledge on PFAPA 
epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, 
and therapeutic options. A structured literature search was performed using 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, focusing on relevant articles specifically 
addressing PFAPA. Increasing evidence suggests multifactorial pathogenesis 
involving innate immune dysregulation, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and 
Th1-driven inflammation. Genetic analysis studies suggest a polygenic 
inheritance of PFAPA, linking it to immune pathways shared with familial 
Mediterranean fever and Behçet's disease. Diagnosis remains clinical, though 
genetic testing may be warranted in specific cases. Management strategies vary 
owing to the absence of standardized guidelines. Oral corticosteroids are highly 
effective for acute episodes but may shorten the interval between flares. Among 
preventive therapies, colchicine appears to reduce attack frequency, although 
evidence of its efficacy is limited, while tonsillectomy is often considered 
curative but recommended for patients with refractory disease or when there is a 
concurrent otolaryngologic indication. Further research is needed to refine 
diagnostic criteria and optimize treatment strategies, ultimately improving 
patients' and caregivers' quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by 
autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab). Morvan syndrome 
(MoS) is a rarer autoimmune disease with neuromyotonia, dysautonomia and 
encephalopathy, associated with antibodies targeting contactin-associated 
protein-like 2 (CASPR2) and may coexist with MG, particularly in patients with 
thymoma.
CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man with AChR-Ab MG was treated with pyridostigmine 
and prednisone for one year and then presented with a severe exacerbation. The 
symptoms were not controlled despite intravenous immunoglobulins and 
plasmapheresis. Chest CT revealed a thymoma. Zilucoplan (a C5 complement 
inhibitor) was started, with rapid improvement. Efgartigimod (a neonatal Fc 
receptor (FcRn) antagonist) was added to stabilise residual symptoms prior to 
thymectomy. Three weeks after the third and final efgartigimod cycle, the 
patient had no symptoms of MG but began to develop profuse sweating, then 
generalised hypertonia, fasciculations, myoclonus and dysautonomia, consistent 
with MoS, which were confirmed by the presence of anti-CASPR2 antibodies. 
Symptoms improved markedly after resumption of efgartigimod.
CONCLUSION: This case provides the first evidence of the efficacy of 
efgartigimod in the treatment of MoS and suggests that FcRn inhibition may be 
beneficial in IgG4-mediated disorders beyond MG. It also highlights the 
importance of considering coexisting autoimmune conditions in thymoma, 
particularly when new symptoms occur under selective immune modulation. Finally, 
it emphasises the need to understand immunopathological mechanisms when choosing 
immunomodulatory treatment.

Wunderlich syndrome, characterized by spontaneous perinephric hematoma with 
subcapsular extension has been scarcely reported in microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA). We report the case of a 45-year-old woman, who presented with 
constitutional symptoms, left-eye episcleritis, and rapidly progressive 
glomerulonephritis. She developed sudden, severe left flank pain with hemoglobin 
drop two days after admission. Both computed tomography (CT) and non-contrast 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed large left-sided perinephric hematoma. CT 
angiography failed to demonstrate intrarenal aneurysms. A remarkable reduction 
in size of her perinephric hematoma was observed after three and a half months 
of treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV CYC) 
following the international guidelines. A literature review on renal vessel 
involvement in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis 
revealed 26 case reports and one case series with 20 cases of renal aneurysms. 
Eighteen cases in the case reports (69.2%) and nine in the case series (45%) 
ruptured their renal arteries. The majority (44.4%) were managed with IV CYC and 
high-dose glucocorticoids. Angioembolization, renal replacement therapy, and 
plasma exchange were used as adjuvant measures. Only three patients (16.7%) 
underwent nephrectomy, while the majority(63.6%) fully recovered.

Overtraining syndrome (OTS) is characterised by persistent fatigue and 
performance decline, but it currently lacks specific diagnostic criteria and 
medical coding. Diagnosis is primarily based on a decline in maximal performance 
and a subjective feeling of 'staleness', after ruling out other medical 
conditions. This study aimed to identify physiological and self-reported 
predictors of OTS by comparing individuals diagnosed with OTS (n=110; 2008-2022) 
with a healthy control group (n=447; 2005-2023). Both groups consisted of 
athletes and recreational exercisers assessed at the Helsinki Sports and 
Exercise Medicine Clinic (HULA). Data were collected through questionnaires and 
spiroergometric testing and subsequently analysed using logistic regression, 
adjusting for age and sex. The results of this study suggest that fatigue, 
dizziness and shortness of breath, along with decreased maximum oxygen uptake 
(V̇O2max), peak blood lactate value (Lamax) and oxygen uptake at both 
ventilatory thresholds (V̇O2VT1 and V̇O2VT2), are significant predictors of OTS 
(p<0.05/54). Among reported health conditions, asthma, allergy, anaemia and 
mental health issues were statistically significant predictors of OTS at the 
0.05 level, but not after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, regular 
spiroergometric testing and symptom monitoring may support earlier diagnosis and 
improved management of OTS in athletes and recreational exercisers.

Idiopathic Retinal Vasculitis, Aneurysms, and Neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome is 
a rare retinal vasculopathy predominantly affecting young individuals. 
Characterized by retinal vasculitis, aneurysmal dilations, exudation, and 
neuroretinitis, IRVAN was initially considered a benign condition. However, 
emerging evidence highlights its potential for severe vision-threatening 
complications, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and intervention. The 
underlying pathogenesis remains unclear, though inflammatory, vascular, and 
neuroretinal mechanisms are implicated. While most insights stem from case 
reports and small cohort studies, IRVAN's clinical presentation varies widely. 
Affected individuals often experience sudden vision loss, typically due to 
macular involvement, retinal ischemia, or neovascular complications. Imaging 
techniques, including fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, 
are essential for diagnosis, allowing detailed visualization of aneurysmal 
changes and ischemic progression. Recent discussions have proposed a 
reclassification of neuroretinitis within the disease framework, suggesting 
alternative nomenclature emphasizing its vascular pathology. Management 
strategies focus on reducing ischemia and inflammation. Panretinal laser 
photocoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy, aiming to mitigate neovascular 
complications. Corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic therapies 
play roles in controlling inflammatory components. Anti-Vascular Endothelial 
Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF) treatments have shown promise, particularly in 
advanced disease stages. Despite these therapeutic options, IRVAN's 
unpredictable course necessitates individualized treatment approaches. Although 
primarily an ocular condition, isolated reports suggest possible systemic 
associations, including intracranial hypertension and autoimmune markers. Future 
research should aim to establish standardized diagnostic criteria and 
therapeutic protocols, enhancing outcomes for affected individuals. This review 
synthesizes current literature to provide insights into clinical presentation, 
imaging features, differential diagnoses, and evolving management strategies for 
this rare disorder.

The human microbiome is a complex ecological system of commensal, symbiotic, and 
pathogenic microorganisms that plays a crucial role in human health and disease. 
The microbiome includes both the living microorganisms also called microbiota 
and their synthesized metabolites and structural components. It is distributed 
to the gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory system, and oral cavity, each 
with a distinct microbial composition. Dysbiosis, or imbalance in the microbiome 
is linked to numerous diseases such as eczema, gastric ulcers, cardiovascular 
diseases, and cancer. The axes of microbial activity and their connections to 
disease, including the gut-skin, gut-lung, gut-brain, and gut-kidney play a 
crucial role in health and disease conditions. Also, the role of the microbiome 
in cancer development and response to therapy is examined. This book chapter 
underscores the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for overall 
health and the potential for microbiome-based interventions in disease 
prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is characterized by 
vaginal dryness, itching, burning, pain during intercourse, and urinary 
symptoms. Traditionally, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), specifically 
estrogen therapy, has been the first-line treatment for GSM, due to its side 
effects, fractional CO2 laser therapy has emerged as an alternative for managing 
GSM symptoms.
AIM: The primary focus is to compare CO2 fractional laser therapy and estrogen 
therapy on postmenopausal women with GSM through systemically reviewing all the 
randomized controlled trials.Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic 
databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane, Scielo, 
UC Berkeley library, and Google Scholar, was performed in October 2024. The 
inclusion criteria targeted randomized controlled trials comparing CO2 
fractional laser therapy and estrogen therapy on postmenopausal women with GSM, 
which used at least 1 of these outcomes: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), 
Vaginal Health Index, Visual Analog Score, and Urinary Distress Inventory 6.
RESULTS: Out of 688 studies, 7 studies were included for final analysis with a 
total of 302 participants: 154 had CO2 fractional laser therapy with a mean age 
of 55.9 years, and 148 had estrogen therapy with a mean age of 57.2 years. The 
analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between CO2 laser and 
estrogen in Vaginal Health Index (mean difference [MD], 1.60; 95% CI, -0.36 to 
3.56; P = .09), FSFI-total (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, -2.03 to 2.23; P = .93), and 
Urinary Distress Inventory 6 (MD, -3.18; 95% CI, -6.77 to 0.42; P = .08). We 
used a sensitivity analysis on the FSFI-arousal subscale due to high 
heterogeneity, excluding 1 study. It showed that the CO2 laser group had a 
statistically significant difference when compared with the estrogen group 
(MD, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79; P = .01).
CONCLUSION: CO2 laser therapy is an effective line of treatment for GSM. 
However, its comparison with estrogen therapy did not reach a statistically 
significant difference favoring one line over the other.

Introduction: Dysphagia presents an important challenge in the rehabilitation of 
brain injured patients. Previously, research on the etiological factors of 
dysphagia has primarily focused on organic causes. However, factors, such as 
psychological and cognitive dysfunctions, may also play crucial role in 
dysphagia. Objective: Our study aims to investigate whether there is a 
relationship between neglect syndrome and dysphagia, moreover, to examine 
whether the duration and quality of speech therapy differ between dysphagic 
patients with neglect and those without neglect. Patients and methods: A 
prospective study was conducted in a rehabilitation unit specializing in brain 
injury patients between January 1, 2021 and May 1, 2022. During this period, 44 
patients received dysphagia therapy. We formed a neglect dysphagia group (n = 8) 
and a functionally matched dysphagia group without neglect (n = 8). Data were 
collected through document analysis, followed by descriptive statistics, 
comparative analysis, and correlation analysis. Results: In the neglect group, 
only preventive therapy could be applied, whereas in the matched control group, 
rehabilitative, compensatory, and preventive therapy methods were used. Spearman 
correlation analysis revealed trend-level association between initial functional 
status and the duration of speech therapy in the neglect group (p = 0.06). In 
the control dysphagia group, a significant correlation was found between the 
length of hospital stay and the duration of speech therapy (p<0.05). Discussion: 
Only half of the patients arrived with dysphagia diagnosis. A trend-level 
difference was observed in the duration of therapy between the two groups, and 
the neglect group required a distinct therapeutic approach. It can be concluded 
that the more severe cognitive status at admission in the neglect group may 
prolong the duration of speech therapy. In the control dysphagia group, hospital 
stay duration was associated with the severity of dysphagia. Conclusion: Neglect 
syndrome influences dysphagia therapy. Weaker cognitive status of neglect 
patients at admission lead to a longer treatment period. Orv Hetil. 2025;

Publisher: Bevezetés: A dysphagia jelentős kihívást okoz az agysérülést 
szenvedett betegek rehabilitációja során. A dysphagiák etiológiai tényezői 
között korábban az organikus okokkal foglalkoztak a leginkább, de az egyéb 
tényezők, a pszichés és kognitív diszfunkciók is jelentős szerepet játszhatnak a 
táplálkozás zavarában. Célkitűzés: Vizsgálatunk célja feltárni, hogy van-e 
kapcsolat a neglektszindróma és a dysphagia között, valamint annak vizsgálata, 
hogy a neglektszindrómás páciensek logopédiai terápiával töltött ideje és annak 
minősége eltér-e a nem neglektszindrómás dysphagiás páciensekétől. Betegek és 
módszerek: Prospektív vizsgálatot végeztünk agysérült betegek rehabilitációjával 
foglalkozó osztályon, a 2021. 01. 01-től 2022. 05. 01-ig tartó időszakra 
vonatkozóan. Ebben az időszakban 44 páciens részesült dysphagiaterápiában. 
Kutatásunkban egy neglektszindrómás dysphagiás csoportot (n = 8) és a hozzá 
funkcionális statusban illesztett (n = 8) dysphagiás, de nem neglektszindrómás 
csoportot alakítottunk ki. Adatainkat dokumentumelemzéssel gyűjtöttük, majd 
leíró statisztikát, összehasonlító és korrelációs elemzéseket végeztünk. 
Eredmények: A neglektszindrómás csoport esetében csak preventív terápiát tudtunk 
alkalmazni, míg az illesztett kontrollcsoportban rehabilitációs, kompenzációs és 
preventív terápiás metódusok is megjelentek. A Spearman-korrelációs vizsgálatból 
tendenciaszintű összefüggés volt kimutatható a felvételi funkcionális status és 
a logopédiai terápia ideje között a neglektszindrómás csoportban (p = 0,06). A 
kontroll dysphagiás csoportban pedig szignifikáns együttjárást találtunk az 
osztályon töltött idő és a logopédiai terápia időtartama között (p<0,05). 
Megbeszélés: A betegek fele érkezett csak dysphagiadiagnózissal. A terápiával 
eltöltött idő között a két csoportban tendenciaszintű eltérést írhatunk le, 
továbbá a neglektes csoport igazoltan más terápiás megközelítést igényel. A 
neglektszindrómás csoportról elmondható, hogy a felvételkori súlyosabb kognitív 
status meghosszabbíthatja a logopédiai terápia idejét. A kontroll dysphagiás 
csoportnál pedig a kórházi tartózkodás ideje összefügg a dysphagia 
súlyosságával. Következtetés: A neglektszindróma befolyásolja a dysphagia 
terápiáját. A neglektes betegek felvételkori kognitív állapota összefügg a 
terápiában eltöltött idejükkel, meghosszabbítja a gyengébb kognitív állapot. Orv

Pelvic pain syndromes are common and often neuropathic, with pudendal neuralgia 
being the most recognized. However, other nerves from the sacral and lumbar 
plexus-including the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, and posterior 
femoral cutaneous branches-may also contribute to pelvic and genital neuropathic 
pain. Diagnosis is challenging due to complex pelvic neuroanatomy and 
overlapping etiologies. MR neurography plays a key role in evaluating affected 
nerves and musculoskeletal structures, with advanced sequences improving 
vascular suppression and nerve conspicuity. While ultrasound and CT mainly guide 
interventions, MR-ultrasound fusion imaging and MR neurography-guided perineural 
injections provide more accurate, image-guided treatment strategies.

Hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) is considered an oncologic emergency. In this 
review, we describe the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and 
treatment of this life-threatening condition. The most common etiology of HVS is 
hypergammaglobulinemia, such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Other causes 
include bone marrow hyperproliferative states, autoimmune diseases, and human 
immunodeficiency virus infection. The presence of mucosal and specifically 
bilateral nasal bleeding, along with neurologic and ophthalmologic symptoms, 
should raise suspicion for HVS, but the condition can affect principally all 
organ systems. Fundoscopic examination is important when evaluating patients 
with HVS. The mainstays of treatment of HVS are supportive care, plasmapheresis, 
and chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
with broad and variable phenotypes including short stature. This study aims to 
determine the long-term effect of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 
treatment on WDSTS and summarize the phenotypes and genotypes of WDSTS.
METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and genetic features of five patients with 
WDSTS, and comprehensively reviewed reported WDSTS diagnostic features.
RESULTS: Four patients had short stature, one exhibited early puberty, and all 
exhibited distinctive facial features, intellectual disabilities, and 
hypertrichosis. Two patients had subnormal GH peaks. Three patients treated with 
rhGH for 1.5-4.9 years showed height gains (1.8, 1.1, and 1.9 standard 
deviations score [SDS]); patient 5 received rhGH and leuprolide for 1 year, with 
0.2 SDS in height gain and controlled bone age. Five KMT2A gene variants were 
identified, four of which were novel. Our review (54 articles including 260 
WDSTS cases) revealed that growth retardation, intellectual delay, distinctive 
facial features, and hirsutism are frequent findings of the condition. Among the 
229 KMT2A gene variants described, frameshift variants were the most common 
(37.7%).
CONCLUSION: Our findings broaden the KMT2A gene variant, clinical, and molecular 
spectra used to diagnose and treat WDSTS, and highlight the crucial role of 
genetic testing in WDSTS diagnosis and the effectiveness of rhGH therapy.

OBJECTIVE: OHVIRA syndrome is a rare condition involving genitourinary 
anomalies, where early diagnosis and intervention can reduce the need for 
complex treatment processes and surgical interventions.
CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old female patient was diagnosed with OHVIRA syndrome and 
treated with antibiotic therapy and vaginal septectomy; however, due to elevated 
CRP levels and severe abdominal pain, a hysterectomy was performed. 
Post-surgery, the patient showed improvement and was discharged.
CONCLUSION: OHVIRA syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly that manifests with 
symptoms during adolescence. The diagnostic and treatment process can be 
challenging and may involve various complications. Early diagnosis and minimally 
invasive surgery alleviate symptoms and preserve reproductive potential. This 
case report highlights the multidisciplinary management of OHVIRA syndrome and 
the complexities of the treatment processes.

INTRODUCTION: Sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS) is an important cause of lower 
back pain, constituting a common source of morbidity, especially in today's 
ageing population. Underlying pathophysiology is complex and likely 
multifactorial. Previous studies have suggested characteristic morphologies of 
the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) shape in pain patients.
AIM: To find morphological markers for SIJS in vivo by evaluating an extensive 
array of, particularly anatomical, measurements of the SIJ, pelvis and 
associated musculature using computed tomography (CT) by comparison with 
non-SIJS control patients.
METHODS: CT scans of 754 patients suffering from SIJS and 116 age-matched 
control patients were analyzed evaluating anatomy and musculoskeletal 
degeneration. Combined and gender-grouped T-tests, Mann-Whitney-U-tests and 
chi-square-tests were conducted. Age correlations were tested using linear 
regressions.
RESULTS: Pelvis and SIJ morphology differed significantly in SIJS patients when 
compared to the control group. Pelves were narrower and deeper, sacra were 
narrower and there was less sacroiliac depth. True SIJ were deeper at S1 level 
and less deep at S2 and S3 levels. There was more sagittal angulation of SIJ at 
S1, S2 and S3 levels. Furthermore, less psoas muscle volume, higher grades of 
fatty degeneration of the back musculature as well as increased cutis/subcutis 
thickness were demonstrated in SIJS patients. Grades of SIJ degeneration were 
higher in all evaluated portions, although moderate in overall extent.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a number of morphological markers 
associated with SIJS, visible in conventional CT imaging. Further studies are 
needed to evaluate for causality, prognostic value and potential impact of these 
factors on individual treatment procedure. In a high-risk population,

PURPOSE: To report the case of uveal effusion syndrome (UES) in a 35-year-old 
woman with psoriasis vulgaris, emphasizing scleral pathology and systemic 
inflammatory contributions mediated by proteomic alterations.
METHODS: Medical history, clinical findings and treatment were reviewed, along 
with histopathological and proteomic analysis.
RESULTS: A 35-year-old woman presented with retinal and choroidal detachments in 
the left eye and scleral thickening (3 mm vs. normal 1 mm). Concurrently, her 
psoriasis symptoms worsened. Histology revealed collagen disorganization and 
extracellular matrix remodeling in the sclera, accompanied by elevated 
inflammatory factors (e.g. MCP-4, RANTES, Fractalkine). Treatment included 
partial sclerotomy, leading to resolution of detachments and improved visual 
acuity.
CONCLUSION: Systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis may contribute to 
UES pathogenesis. Dermatologists should refer psoriasis patients for 
ophthalmologic examinations, while ophthalmologists should be aware of 
underlying health conditions when treating UES.

Laboratory diagnostics play a decisive role in rheumatology. In addition to 
various autoantibodies, molecular genetic tests also help to classify a wide 
range of symptom complexes and ultimately to make a diagnosis. 
Histocompatibility genes, such as HLA-B51 are clinically important in the 
context of Behcet's disease, as is the detection of mutations in the diagnosis 
of monogenic hereditary fever syndromes, e.g. in the MEVF gene in familial 
Mediterranean fever. When initiating genetic testing, it is important to 
consider the legal basis, such as the obligation to provide information as well 
as patients' rights. In addition, it is necessary to be aware of the clinical 
and epidemiological characteristics of the different diseases in order to be 
able to initiate diagnostics that are as targeted as possible. As with antibody 
diagnostics, genetic tests in rheumatology must always be interpreted in the 
clinical context and never have any diagnostic or even therapeutic relevance on 
their own.

Publisher: Die Labordiagnostik spielt in der Rheumatologie eine entscheidende 
Rolle. Neben diversen Autoantikörpern helfen auch molekulargenetische 
Untersuchungen bei der Einordnung unterschiedlichster Symptomkomplexe und 
letztlich der Diagnosestellung. Klinisch von Bedeutung sind hier einerseits die 
HLA-Allele wie HLA-B51 im Kontext des Morbus Behçet, aber auch der Nachweis von 
Mutationen monogen vererbter hereditärer Fiebersyndrome, z. B. im MEVF-Gen beim 
familiären Mittelmeerfieber. Wichtig bei der Veranlassung genetischer 
Untersuchungen ist es, die rechtlichen Grundlagen wie die Aufklärungspflicht 
sowie die Rechte der Patienten zu kennen. Darüber hinaus sollte man sich die 
klinischen und epidemiologischen Merkmale der unterschiedlichen Erkrankungen 
bewusst machen, um so eine möglichst zielgerichtete Diagnostik in die Wege 
leiten zu können. Denn genau wie bei der Antikörperdiagnostik gilt auch bei 
genetischen Untersuchungen in der Rheumatologie der Grundsatz, dass 
entsprechende Ergebnisse immer im klinischen Kontext zu interpretieren sind und 
nie für sich allein genommen eine diagnostische oder gar therapeutische Relevanz 
nach sich ziehen.

Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) was described in 1991. It consists 
of a rupture of the main pancreatic duct, with the formation of fluid 
connections alimented by the secretion of disconnected pancreatic segments. Its 
treatment is challenging, and the diagnosis is frequently established with 
considerable delay.
AIM: To describe our experiences with the diagnosis and treatment of DPDS.
METHOD: Observational retrospective study of clinical files of patients admitted 
to our hospital between 2015 and 2024 with DPDS diagnosis. Analysis of 
demographic data, interventions, and late outcomes of patients.
RESULTS: 21 patients were included, 15 males, aged 53 years (range 24-76). All 
patients had severe necrotizing pancreatitis. The diagnostic delay of DPDS was 
20 (range 1-432) weeks. None of the patients was sent with an established 
diagnosis. All patients required multiple endoscopic and/or radiologic 
interventions, three of which were operated on. One patient died in the acute 
phase. New onset diabetes mellitus was observed in 11 patients; 5 of them 
required insulin treatment. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was detected in 12 
cases. One patient died after a nine-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: DPDS is a frequently overlooked complication of necrotizing 
pancreatitis. Management requires multiple minimally invasive interventions, 
with frequent relapses. Mortality is low and late consequences include exocrine 
and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

PURPOSE: Pineal cysts (PC) are benign cysts of the pineal gland (PG). Some 
patients with PCs have nonspecific symptoms such as headache, sleep 
disturbances, dizziness, and nausea. In cases of hydrocephalus or Parinaud 
syndrome, surgical removal of the cyst is the gold standard. However, even 
without evidence of these signs and symptoms, some patients are offered to 
undergo surgery. Regarding the indication, the surgical methodology and the 
clinical outcome in case of unspecific symptoms, evidence is insufficient.
METHODS: All patients undergoing microsurgical fenestration for PC from 2005 - 
2021 were included in the analysis. A survey was carried out inquiring about 
preoperative symptoms, limitations in daily activities, medication use, and 
postoperative improvement. Preoperative radiological parameters were also 
evaluated. The primary endpoint of this study was symptom improvement at last 
follow-up, as assessed by our survey. Radiographic and clinical factors were 
evaluated for their correlation with symptom improvement. Secondary endpoints 
were surgical complications, such as surgical site infections (SSI), 
cerebrospinal fluid fistula (CSF fistula), intraoperative bleeding and 
mortality.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis. The follow-up 
period ranged from 5 to 176 months, with an average follow-up time of 
84.13 months (about 7 years) post-surgery. Mean preoperative visual analogue 
scale (VAS) was 7 (SD 2.34), while postoperatively it was 1 (SD 1.91). The 
majority of patients (94%) showed a decrease in their VAS postoperatively. In a 
paired-sample t-test for the VAS, the postoperative improvement was 
statistically significant (p < .001). No mortality or severe adverse events were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical cyst fenestration can yield symptom improvement in 
non-hydrocephalic patients with PC and unspecific symptoms. Further work is 
needed to validate both this surgical technique and indications therefor.

Caplan's syndrome, also known as rheumatoid pneumoconiosis, is characterized by 
pulmonary nodules and rheumatoid arthritis in patients with pneumoconiosis. 
Owing to its low incidence rate and the presence of multiple nodules on lung 
computed tomography, it is often mistaken for other pulmonary diseases. Herein, 
we report the case of a 60-year-old man who presented to the hospital with joint 
edema and recurrent polyarthralgia. Laboratory studies revealed higher levels of 
rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, together with an 
enhanced erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Chest high-resolution computed 
tomography revealed multiple bilateral nodules during the evaluation for 
treatment contraindications. Based on the patient's occupational background and 
findings from multidisciplinary consultations, a definitive diagnosis of Caplan 
syndrome was made. Maintenance therapy included low-dose methylprednisolone 
(gradually tapered and discontinued over 3 months), methotrexate, and 
hydroxychloroquine. The patient's arthralgia and pulmonary nodules demonstrated 
stability over a follow-up period of up to 4 years, thereby indicating the 
success of this treatment.

management of obstructed defecation syndrome: a clinical review.

Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a multifactorial pelvic floor disorder 
commonly affecting women, characterized by straining, incomplete evacuation, and 
dependence on manual maneuvers. Among various surgical options, stapled 
transanal rectal resection (STARR) and laparoscopic or robotic ventral mesh 
rectopexy (LVMR/RVMR) are frequently employed. However, the comparative 
effectiveness of these procedures remains debated. This narrative review 
synthesizes evidence from 43 studies including randomized trials, cohort 
studies, registries, and systematic reviews published between 2004 and 2025. 
Clinical outcomes assessed include symptom relief, recurrence, quality of life 
(QoL), complications, and cost-effectiveness. The methodological quality of 
included studies was evaluated using the SANRA tool. Both STARR and LVMR/RVMR 
provide significant early symptom relief in ODS. STARR shows 70-90% short-term 
improvement, but recurrence rates up to 40% have been reported at 10 years. LVMR 
achieves durable functional outcomes with recurrence rates < 10%, superior QoL 
metrics, and fewer anatomical relapses. Mesh-related complications after LVMR 
are rare (~ 1.4%), but require long-term monitoring. Economically, while STARR 
has lower initial costs, LVMR/RVMR demonstrates greater long-term 
cost-effectiveness due to reduced reoperations. RVMR may enhance surgical 
precision, but increases upfront expenses. STARR remains a valid option for 
isolated rectocele or low-grade intussusception, whereas LVMR/RVMR is preferable 
for complex pelvic floor dysfunction. Current evidence favors ventral rectopexy 
for sustained outcomes, although methodological heterogeneity limits definitive 
conclusions. Prospective, standardized, long-term comparative trials are 
essential to optimize surgical strategies for ODS.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the treatment outcomes and toxicity profile of stereotactic 
body radiation therapy (SBRT) for second-course radiation therapy (RT) in 
patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 191 patients treated with SBRT between 
September 2007 and February 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were 
stratified based on Multi-Institution Reirradiation Collaborative recursive 
partitioning analysis (RPA) score. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed 
to assess overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and 
locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS). Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting 
carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS), with receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis to determine significant cutoff values.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 13 months (range, 1-178.69 months) for the 
entire cohort and 19 months (range, 1-178 months) for surviving patients. 
Two-year OS was 39%, with a median survival of 15.2 months. The 2-year PFS was 
21%, with a median PFS of 9.5 months. Significant predictors of OS included the 
interval between RT courses (P = .01) and gross tumor volume (P = .02). Primary 
tumor location (nasopharynx vs other primary locations) and the interval between 
RT courses were predictive of both PFS and LRRFS (P = .01, P = .04, and P = .04, 
P = .01, respectively). Gross tumor volume was prognostic for LRRFS (P = .02). 
Multi-Institution Reirradiation Collaborative RPA classification was not a 
prognostic factor. Late ≥grade 3 toxicity occurred in 43 patients (22.5%), with 
26 patients (13.6%) experiencing CBOS. Age and carotid artery entrapment ≥180° 
were identified as predictors for CBOS. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis established an optimal age cutoff of 51 years for predicting CBOS, with 
73% sensitivity and 72% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Reirradiation with SBRT is feasible for treating recurrent head and 
neck cancer. Patient selection is critical for identifying suitable candidates 
for SBRT, and a distinct RPA score may be required for these patients. 
Prophylactic measures and close follow-up are essential for high-risk patients 
to prevent CBOS.

Triple M Overlap Syndrome is an ultra-rare and seldom-described immune-related 
adverse event (irAE) secondary to pembrolizumab therapy. This entity and its 
namesake are due to auto-immune phenomena involving myocardium, striated muscle 
and neuromuscular junction, yielding a syndrome of myocarditis, myositis and 
myasthenia gravis. Since it was first identified in 1975, only 100 cases of this 
syndrome are found in the literature. With the increasing use of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of various malignancies, however, 
more cases are likely to be diagnosed in the future. We present a patient who 
received her first cycle of pembrolizumab therapy 3 weeks prior to presentation 
with complaints of intense myalgias, diffuse muscle weakness and ptosis. 
Investigative workup revealed myocarditis, myositis and myasthenia gravis. 
Treatment with high-dose steroids plus plasma exchange drastically improved her 
symptoms. This case demonstrates the presenting symptoms, diagnostic findings, 
critical complications and management strategies of Triple M Overlap Syndrome.

Louisville, Louisville, KY.

Checkrein syndrome is a rare condition affecting the flexor hallucis longus 
(FHL) tendon as a result of either surgery or trauma. Checkrein syndrome is 
defined as the occurrence of hallux malleus upon dorsiflexion of the ankle, 
which is reduced upon plantarflexion of the ankle. The literature supports 
various treatments for this condition; however, lengthening of the FHL tendon 
remains the mainstay of treatment. In this case series, we describe two cases of 
checkrein syndrome with different etiologies: pilon fracture and gunshot wound 
to the leg. Both of these cases were successfully treated with FHL tendon 
lengthening, with one case requiring a hallux interphalangeal joint arthrodesis.

Extremity Cellulitis.

Löfgren's syndrome is an acute, self-limiting variant of sarcoidosis, typically 
presenting with erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and acute 
arthritis or periarthritis-most commonly involving the ankles. Its clinical 
overlap with other inflammatory conditions can pose a diagnostic challenge. We 
describe a 34-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with 
bilateral ankle and foot pain, erythema, and swelling, initially diagnosed as 
cellulitis based on imaging findings. He has no response to broad-spectrum 
antibiotics. During his further hospital stay, he developed polyarthritis. 
Laboratory evaluation revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory 
markers, and a normal serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level. Imaging showed 
bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and intra-abdominal adenopathy. Bronchoscopy 
with bronchoalveolar lavage revealed an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio (5.0), and 
endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration confirmed 
noncaseating granulomas. Infectious, autoimmune, and malignant causes were 
excluded. Based on clinical features and histology, a diagnosis of Löfgren's 
syndrome was established. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy led to 
rapid clinical improvement, and antibiotics were discontinued. Löfgren's 
syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with bilateral lower 
extremity erythema and swelling unresponsive to antibiotics, especially when 
accompanied by systemic symptoms. Early thoracic imaging and consideration of 
sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis can prevent misdiagnosis and 
unnecessary treatment.

BACKGROUND: National studies on reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome 
(RCVS) point to differences between Asian and European patients. We investigated 
geographic variations in neurological complications, outcomes, and causes.
METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis of pooled individual patient data 
from the Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome International 
Collaborative network, a multicenter observational cohort study including 
patients with definite RCVS from 2 French, 32 Italian, 1 South Korean, and 1 
Taiwanese centers. Data on demographics, precipitants, symptoms, imaging, 
treatment, and outcomes were collected. The primary end point was 
RCVS-associated brain lesions, including ischemic stroke, cortical subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome, and subdural hematoma. Secondary end points included unfavorable 
3-month outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score ≥1) and causes (idiopathic versus 
secondary). Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic 
regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2021, we included 1127 patients (528 European and 599 
Asian). Recruitment occurred either through emergency settings or outpatient 
clinics, with most Asian patients recruited from outpatient clinics (65.8%) and 
most European patients from emergency settings (99.8%). Brain lesions were more 
frequent in European patients (29.2% versus 6.3%; odds ratio, 4.09 [95% CI, 
2.66-6.30]). In a sensitivity analysis restricted to hospitalized patients 
(n=651), the association persisted. Unfavorable 3-month outcomes (5.5% versus 
1.7%; odds ratio, 3.01 [95% CI, 1.35-6.68]) and secondary RCVS (50.4% versus 
10.9%; odds ratio, 7.09 [95% CI, 5.14-9.76]) were also associated with European 
residency.
CONCLUSIONS: RCVS presentations vary across regions, with higher lesion rates, 
more secondary forms, and worse outcomes in European patients. While these 
exploratory results may reflect selection bias from differing health care 
structures, further research is needed to determine the contribution of genetic, 
environmental, and societal factors.

The concept of differentiation therapy emerged from the fact that hormones or 
cytokines may promote differentiation ex vivo, thereby irreversibly changing the 
phenotype of cancer cells. Its hallmark success has been the treatment of acute 
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a condition that is now highly curable by the 
combination of retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic. Differentiation syndrome (DS) is 
a common and potentially life-threatening condition that was initially described 
with the induction therapy of targeted agents in acute promyelocytic leukemia 
(APL). DS is typically marked by symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, 
low blood pressure, weight gain, fluid buildup in the pleural or pericardial 
cavities, and acute kidney failure. The incidence of DS in APL patients varies 
from 2 to 27% reflecting the discrepancies in diagnostic criteria, in various 
treatment protocols, and sometimes the use of preventive treatments. 
Corticosteroids, with or without cytoreductive therapy, should be initiated 
immediately upon suspicion of DS to mitigate related morbidity and mortality. In 
cases of severe DS, targeted anti-leukemic therapy should be halted. This review 
will cover the pathogenesis of DS, its clinical presentations, diagnostic 
criteria, management approaches, and the importance of implementing prospective 
tracking in clinical trials.

Objective: To explore the impact of neoadjuvant immunotherapy on the occurrence 
of low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) in patients with locally advanced 
rectal cancer who underwent restorative anterior resection, and to analyze 
associated risk factors. Methods: This study was an observational study. 
Patients with adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, or signet ring cell 
carcinoma of the rectum located 0-10 cm from the anal verge who received 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy followed by curative restorative anterior resection at 
Peking University Cancer Hospital between November 2019 and February 2024 were 
retrospectively examined. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) metastasis 
detected preoperatively;(2) follow-up <1 year or stoma closure <6 months; (3) 
local recurrence or metastasis during follow-up; and (4) stoma without closure 
or stoma re-creation. The Chinese version of the LARS questionnaire was used to 
assess bowel function by telephone interview, and patients were classified based 
on score into no LARS (0-20 points), minor LARS (21-29 points), and major LARS 
(30-42 points). The incidence of LARS, major LARS, and associated risk factors 
were analyzed. Results: A total of 52 patients (34 men) were included for 
analysis. Mean age was 58.0 ± 9.8 years and mean body mass index was 25.1 ± 2.6 
kg/m2. Median follow-up was 27.5 months (range, 12.0-63.7). Median LARS score 
was 21 (range, 1-41). Twenty-six patients (50.0%) developed LARS after surgery, 
and half of these (13 cases) were classified as major LARS. Stool clustering 
(repeated defecation within 1 hour) was observed in 80.8% (42/52) of patients. 
Distance between the tumor edge and the dentate line [odds ratio (OR), 3.597; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 1.140-11.360; P=0.026], management of the left 
colic artery (OR, 0.133; 95% CI, 0.026-0.691; P=0.008), and interval of stoma 
closure (OR, 5.250; 95%CI, 1.381-19.960; P=0.011) were significantly associated 
with LARS. Interval of stoma closure was significantly associated with major 
LARS (OR, 4.200; 95%CI, 1.064-16.584; P=0.040). In multivariate logistic 
regression, ≤3.5 cm between the tumor edge and the dentate line (OR, 7.407; 
95%CI, 1.377-40.000; P=0.020), non-preservation of the left colic artery (OR, 
8.403; 95%CI, 1.183-58.823; P=0.033) and interval of stoma closure >6 months 
(OR, 10.865; 95% CI, 2.039-57.896; P=0.005) were independent risk factors for 
LARS. Interval of stoma closure >6 months (OR, 4.356; 95% CI, 1.105-17.167; 
P=0.035) were independent risk factors for major LARS. Conclusion: Patients with 
locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
experienced a high incidence of LARS after curative surgery, with stool 
clustering as the predominant symptom. Tumor edge-dentate line distance ≤3.5 cm, 
non-preservation of the left colic artery, and interval of stoma closure >6 
months were risk factors for LARS.

Publisher: 目的： 探索局部进展期直肠癌新辅助免疫治疗联合根治性手术后低位前切除综合征（LARS）发生情况及其相关危险因素。 方法： 
本研究采用观察性研究方法。回顾性纳入2019年11月至2024年2月期间，于北京大学肿瘤医院接受新辅助免疫治疗并行根治性直肠手术的直肠癌患者。病例纳入标准：（1）接受根治性直肠低位前切除手术，病理确诊为直肠腺癌、黏液腺癌或印戒细胞癌；（2）初诊肠镜或影像学检查提示肿瘤下缘距离肛缘0~10 
cm；（3）接受过新辅助免疫治疗。排除标准：（1）术前发现远处转移；（2）末次随访距根治性手术<1年或肠道连续性恢复<6个月；（3）随访出现肿瘤局部复发或远处转移；（4）造口状态或二次造口者。采取电话随访方式对入组患者进行肠道功能评估。量表使用汉化版LARS评分问卷，并根据量表评分将患者分为无LARS（0~20分）、轻度LARS（21~29分）和重度LARS（30~42分），分析新辅助免疫治疗组患者术后LARS和重度LARS的患病率，以及相关危险因素分析。 
结果： 
全组52例患者，其中男性34例；年龄为（58.0±9.8）岁；体质指数为（25.1±2.6）kg/m2。中位随访27.5（12.0~63.7）个月，本组患者中位LARS评分为21（1~41）分，共有26例（50.0%）患者存在LARS，其中13例为重度LARS。80.8%（42/52）的患者存在不同程度的排便簇集（1 
h内反复排便）。单因素分析结果显示：MRI肿瘤下缘距齿状线距离（OR=3.597，95%CI：1.140~11.360，P=0.026）、左结肠动脉处理方式（OR=0.133，95%CI：0.026~0.691，P=0.008）、手术-还纳时间间隔（OR=5.250，95%CI：1.381~19.960，P=0.011）与术后LARS的发生有关；手术-还纳时间间隔（OR=4.200，95%CI：1.064~16.584，P=0.040）与重度LARS的发生有关。Logistic多因素回归分析显示：MRI肿瘤下缘距齿状线距离≤3.5 
cm（OR=7.407，95%CI：1.377~40.000，P=0.020）、不保留左结肠血管（OR=8.403，95%CI：1.183~58.823，P=0.033）、手术-还纳时间间隔>6个月（OR=10.865，95%CI：2.039~57.896，P=0.005）是本组患者术后发生LARS的独立危险因素；手术-还纳时间间隔>6个月（OR=4.356，95%CI：1.105~17.167，P=0.035）是发生重度LARS的独立危险因素。 
结论： 接受新辅助免疫治疗的直肠癌患者于根治性手术后LARS发生率较高，排便簇集是其最主要的症状。肿瘤下缘与齿状线距离≤3.5 
cm、术中不保留左结肠血管和手术造口还纳间隔时间>6个月是本组患者发生LARS的危险因素。.
